Abstract Several indigenous Saccharomyces strains from
musts were isolated in the Jerez de la Frontera region, at the
end of spontaneous fermentation, in order to select the most
suitable autochthonous yeast starter, during the 2007 vin-
tage. Five strains were chosen for their oenological abilities
and fermentative kinetics to elaborate a Sherry base wine.
The selected autochthonous strains were characterized by
molecular methods: electrophoretic karyotype and random
ampliﬁed polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction
(RAPD-PCR) and by physiological parameters: fermentative
power, ethanol production, sugar consumption, acidity and
volatile compound production, sensory quality, killer phe-
notype, desiccation, and sulphur dioxide tolerance. Labora-
tory- and pilot-scale fermentations were conducted with
those autochthonous strains. One of them, named J4, was
ﬁnally selected over all others for industrial fermentations.
The J4 strain, which possesses exceptional fermentative
properties and oenological qualities, prevails in industrial
fermentations, and becomes the principal biological agent
responsible for winemaking. Sherry base wine, industrially
manufactured by means of the J4 strain, was analyzed,yielding, together with its sensory qualities, ﬁnal average
values of 0.9 g/l sugar content, 13.4 % (v/v) ethanol content
and 0.26 g/l volatile acidity content; apart from a high
acetaldehyde production, responsible for the distinctive
aroma of ‘ ‘Fino’ ’. This base wine was selected for ‘‘Fino’ ’
Sherry elaboration and so it was fortiﬁed; it is at present
being subjected to biological aging by the so-called ‘‘ﬂor’ ’
yeasts. The ‘ ‘ﬂor’’ velum formed so far is very high quality.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study covering
from laboratory to industrial scale of characterization and
selection of autochthonous starter intended for alcoholic
fermentation in Sherry base wines. Since the 2010 vintage,
the indigenous J4 strain is employed to industrially manu-
facture a homogeneous, exceptional Sherry base wine for
‘‘Fino’ ’ Sherry production.

Introduction
‘‘Fino’’ wine is a fortiﬁed Sherry white wine manufactured in
the Jerez de la Frontera region (Ca ´diz), southwestern Spain.
Grapes, which are collected in September, used to be hand-
picked, but mechanical harvesting methods are increasingly
being employed now. The special production (supervised by
the ‘‘Consejo Regulador de las Denominaciones de Origen
Jerez-Xe ´re`s-Sherry, Manzanilla-Sanlu ´car de Barrameda y
Vinagre de Jerez’’, http://www.sherry.org/ ) of such out-
standing wine consists essentially of two different stages,
each one conducted by means of two fully different micro-
organism populations. First, grape juice is fermented mainly
by autochthonous fermentative yeasts to produce a low
acidity white base wine. After fermentation, base wine is

DOI 10.1007/s10295-013-1251-0subjected to sensory classiﬁcation by a panel of experts.
According to such classiﬁcation, the ﬁnest base wines are
selected for ‘‘Fino’’ wine production and so are fortiﬁed to
15.5 % (v/v) ethanol content, intended to undergo biologicalaging under indigenous ‘‘ﬂor’’ yeasts. The desirable Sherry
base wine for ‘‘Fino’’ production is not only typically pale
and low in volatile acidity content, but fruity and dry (under1 g/l ﬁnal sugar content) with over 11–12.5 % (v/v) ethanol
content. Biological aging developed (for at least 3 years)
under the oxidative metabolism of a population of ‘‘ﬂor’’
yeasts forming a ‘‘ﬂor’’ velum, a bioﬁlm on the air–liquid
interface of the wine. The ﬁnal ‘‘Fino’’ wine is a straw-yellow, low-acidity dry wine (equal or under 0.25 g/l vola-
tile acidity, equal or under 3.5 g/l total acidity) and high
acetaldehyde content (up to 700–800 mg/l) possessingalmond and yeast (‘‘ﬂor’’) ﬂavor [ 1,5,38].
The knowledge and literature on ‘ ‘ﬂor’’ yeasts is increasing.
Many different yeast populations have been identiﬁed [ 7,11,
15,22] and dynamics and successive ‘ ‘ﬂor’’ yeast populations
during biological aging have been described too [ 16,18,23,
27]. Velum formation by ﬁlmogenic ‘‘ﬂor’ ’ yeasts and its
metabolism at physiological and molecular level have been
studied by various authors [ 2,4,14,19,25,26,45]. Addi-
tionally, biological aging conducted by selected ‘‘ﬂor’’ yeasthas been published [ 28,31]. Despite the wide knowledge on
‘‘ﬂor’’ yeast, the yeasts responsible for alcoholic fermentation
in Sherry wine have not yet deserved a great deal of attention,and the literature gaps in this area are signiﬁcant, for there are
still very few studies [ 16].
The traditional Sherry winemaking method includes
spontaneous fermentation that produces distinguished
wines, but this practice involves certain well-known risks
such as irreproducible or undesirable ﬂavors and aromas,uncompleted sugar depletion, slow or stuck fermentations,
etc. The inoculation of selected strains, such as commercial
active dry yeast, has been a widespread winemaking practiceover the last few decades as a means to conduct fermentation
[34,42]. Consequently, commercial active dry yeast is being
used in some wineries at the Jerez de la Frontera region.Furthermore, there is a certain degree of controversy over
this matter, since the use of commercial yeasts may diminish
complexity and typicity. In addition, an indigenous starteradjusts to the ecological and technological features of a
region all the more easily [ 21] preserving the wine’s typicity
[20,35,43]. So, today, the goal is to select a suitable
indigenous yeast capable of performing alcoholic fermen-
tation [ 8,12,17,33]. However, the literature about
autochthonous fermentative strain selection, and/or itscharacterization, to obtain base wine that may be used in the
Sherry system is almost non-existent. The goal of this study
has been the isolation of such strains.
Autochthonous fermentative yeast starters, which are
able to maintain typicity in Sherry wine, and can adjust tooenological practices and characteristics in this wine-
making area, were isolated during the 2007 vintage. In the
2008–2010 vintages, pilot-scale and industrial-scale fer-
mentations were carried out with some of those yeasts. Onestrain (named J4) was eventually chosen over the rest to
routinely conduct alcoholic fermentations at a local winery
within the ﬁrst stage in ‘‘Fino’’ production. The isolation,selection, and characterization of yeast strains, covering
from laboratory to industrial conditions, are described in
this study.
Materials and methods
Laboratory and industrial mediaLaboratory-, pilot-, and industrial-scale fermentations were
performed in industrial musts from 2007 to 2010 vintagesobtained from the Palomino ‘‘Fino’’ grape variety in the
Jerez de la Frontera region. Those musts were kindly
provided by Beam Global Espan ˜a S. L. winery, and typi-
cally contained 80–100 mg/l total added sulphur dioxide,
Baume ´grade ( 8Be´) from [10.5 to \14 and pH adjusted to
3.2–3.4. One 8Be´equals 17 g/l fermentable sugar.
Laboratory media YPD and YPD agar (1 % yeast
extract, 2 % glucose, 2 % peptone and 2 % agar) were
used for propagation and maintenance of yeast.
Yeast strains
Reference strains for fermentation assays were: C1 (IFI
1693) wine yeast strain from the ‘‘Instituto de Fermenta-
ciones Industriales’’ collection (Madrid, Spain) and C2(Fermol /C210super16) commercial active dried yeast from
AEB Group (Brescia, Italy). Sensitive killer (non-producer)
laboratory strain 47G, K1 toxin producer killer strain 1101and K2 toxin producer killer strain 1384 were kindly pro-
vided by Dr. R. Esteban (University of Salamanca, Spain).
Isolation and selection of yeasts from spontaneous
industrial fermentations
Two spontaneous fermentations were carried out in 30,000-l
stainless-steel vats, each containing 25,000 l of must, at a
Jerez de la Frontera cellar during the 2007 vintage. Fer-mentation processes were checked by four daily temperature
and sugar content ( 8Be´) measurements. 8Be´was determined
by means of a density meter according to the Ofﬁce Inter-national de la Vigne et du Vin procedure (OIV) [ 30]. At the
end of fermentations (typically 8Be´reached 0 value), 50-ml
samples were taken in sterile bottles from the middle zone ineach fermenter. Samples were transported on ice to the
laboratory for processing. One hundred SaccharomycesJ Ind Microbiol Biotechnol
123colonies, 50 from each fermenter, were randomly selected
for study following procedures described [ 3].
At a ﬁrst stage, yeasts were screened for the ability to
ferment vigorously Palomino ‘‘Fino’’ grape musts at hightemperature (30 /C176C) in sterile small-scale fermentations
(10 ml in duplicate). At a second phase, volatile acidity
was measured at the end of those small-scale fermenta-tions, production of ﬁnal volatile acidity showing a
Gaussian distribution (mean value was 0.71 g/l and mode
value was 0.42 g/l; standard deviation was 0.25, n=100).
The ﬁve strains that produced less volatile acidity and were
also able to exhaust sugar content at 30 /C176C were then
named J1, J2, J3, J4, and J5, and were chosen for further
characterization.
Electrophoretic karyotype
The basic procedure followed for chromosomal DNA
preparation was that of Codo ´n et al. [ 10]. The system used
was a CHEF-DRII /C210gel electrophoresis apparatus from
Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA). Electropho-resis was carried out at 14 /C176C and 200 V for 16 h with a
70 s switching time and then for 12 h with 120 s switching
time.
Random ampliﬁed polymorphic DNA-polymerase
chain reaction (RAPD-PCR)
DNA extractions were performed with the help of Master-
Pure
TMYeast DNA Puriﬁcation Kit (Epicentre Biotech-
nologies, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturers’
instructions. RAPD proﬁles were generated using decamer
primers from ‘‘Operon Technologies Primer Kit’’. Thenucleotide sequences of primers used were the following:
OPA-1, 5
0-CAGGCCCTTC-30; OPA-10, 50-GTGATCGC
AG-30. Ampliﬁcations were carried out in a TC-512 ther-
mocycler (Techne Inc., Burlington, USA) with Illustra
puReTaq Ready-To-Go PCR Beads (GE Healthcare, Hert-
fordshire, UK). Condition reactions were as described inFernandez-Espinar et al. [ 41]. RAPD-PCR proﬁles were
analyzed by agarose gel (1 %) electrophoresis; image was
captured under UV light in UVP Imaging System.
Killer assays
Production, sensitivity, and/or resistance to killer toxins K1
or K2 were determined on YPD (pH 4.2) blue plates as
described [ 37].
Microviniﬁcation assays
Pure microviniﬁcation assays were conducted in sterile
ﬂasks containing 800 ml of must, without shaking, at28/C176C. Pre-cultured strains were inoculated at 0.1 optical
density, measured at 660 nm (O.D.
660), the industrial must
was previously sterilized by ﬁltration (0.45- lm pore-size
membrane ﬁlters). Samples were taken daily under sterileconditions in order to monitor fermentations; reduced sugar
content was measured as described by Somogyi [ 36] and
modiﬁed by Nelson [ 29].
Oenological parametersFinal sugar concentration and volatile acidity were deter-
mined by injection ﬂux in an Autoanalyzer AIII(Bran ?Luebbe GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany) according
to the manufacturers’ indications, and were expressed as
g/l. Ethanol content was determined by distillation, fol-lowing the ofﬁcial OIV method (OIV) [ 30].
Volatile compounds were determined by gas chroma-
tography in a Hewlett-Packard (Palo Alto, CA, USA) 5890Series II chromatograph equipped with capillary injector
(250/C176C), ﬂame ionization detector (250 /C176C), capillary
column (CP-WAX-57CB from Agilent Technologies)(45–200 /C176C, with 3 /C176C/min ramp), and spilt injection;
nitrogen was the carrier gas. Acetaldehyde was determined
by gas chromatography in a Hewlett-Packard (Palo Alto,CA, USA) 5890 Series II chromatograph equipped with
packed columns injector ﬂame ionization detector, and a
column containing 0.5 % Carbowax 1500 on Carbopack.Temperatures of injector and detector were 175–250 /C176C,
respectively; nitrogen was the carrier gas (30 ml/min).
Glycerine was determined by HPLC with a Waters chro-matograph equipped with a refractive index detector, four
15-cm Fast-Fruit-Juice column from Waters. Temperatures
of the column and detector were 55 and 38 /C176C, respec-
tively; mobile phase was phosphoric acid at 0.25 ml/l in
Milli-Q quality water.
Sensory evaluation
Sensory evaluations were conducted according to the pro-
cedure previously employed for other base wines, as
described in Torrens et al. [ 42]. Fermented musts were
sensory evaluated by ﬁve to seven wine-taster experts pertest, according to availability. Those experts were pre-
qualiﬁed and trained and were those who usually evaluate
stocks from the winery. Four independent tests were car-ried out. Must fermented by means of each strain was
present in 2–4 tests. Fermented musts were presented in
clear glass bottles, and aliquot samples were served inwine-taster glasses. Evaluations were conducted at room
temperature. The tasters were asked to rate global sensory
quality of samples from 1 (worst) to 6 (best) in order toevaluate acceptability and potential use of base wine
intended for Sherry production, following the standardJ Ind Microbiol Biotechnol
123procedure of the winery. The ﬁnal scores were normalized
on a scale from 1 to 10.
Sulphur dioxide (SO 2) tolerance test
SO2content was adjusted by adding sulphating agent
‘‘Winy’’ from Enartis (Novara, Italy), that contains SO 2in
the potassium metabisulphite form, to the grape juice.
Strains, pre-cultured in sterile Palomino must (without
SO2), were inoculated at 0.01 optical density, measured at
620 nm (O.D. 620), in sterile must containing different
amounts of total SO 2(0, 50, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250,
300 ppm) in accordance with winery criteria. Cultures
were aliquoted in 96-well microplates: each microplate was
prepared in quadruplicate and was incubated for 24 h; twoof them at 27 /C176C, and the other two at 34 /C176C. O.D.
620was
measured from 10 to 24 h in a microplate reader (Lab-
systems iEMS Reader MF, Ramat-Gan, Israel). Alterna-tively, tolerance tests were carried out for longer periods of
time and greater volumes; pre-cul tured strains were inoculated
at 0.1 (O.D.
660) in 150 ml of must containing a total of 300 ppm
SO2; sugar content was measured daily.
Desiccation tolerance testA desiccation tolerance test was performed as described by
Takagi et al. [ 40] with some modiﬁcations: Samples at
stationary phase were taken from YPD cultures, washed in
sterile distilled water, ﬁltered, and dried at 30 /C176C until
constant dried weight was reached. After that, samplesfrom the dried biomass were rehydrated in sterile distilled
water at 37 /C176C for 30 min.
Viability was determined by a ﬂow-cytometric assay
(BD FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer, NJ, USA) as described
by Boid et al. [ 6] using ﬂuorescence dye oxonol, which
stains dead cells bright green.
Pilot-scale viniﬁcations
Pilot-scale viniﬁcations, during the 2008 vintage, were
carried out in 30,000-l stainless-steel vats, each containing
25,000 l of must. The temperature was kept below 28 /C176C.
Alcoholic fermentation behavior was evaluated daily by
8Be´measurement and by counting cells. For scaling-up,
selected yeast strains were cultured at the laboratory insterile ﬂasks containing 20 l of YPD until the stationary
phase was reached. Each culture was aliquoted in several
sterile bottles and biomass was then collected by centri-fugation. The pellets were resuspended in sterile distilled
water, collected, and transferred together to a sole sterile
ﬂask; they were washed twice in sterile distilled water.Moist pellets were transported to a cellar. Those moistpellets were divided into two halves to inoculate two non-
sterile vats containing 20 l of Palomino ‘‘Fino’’ musts.
When must reached vigorous fermentation (after 24–48 h,
cell density was ca. 10
8cells/ml, and 8Be´ca. 6–7) it was
used to inoculate bigger volumes of non-sterile must. Cell
number was estimated by microscopy using a Bu ¨rker
chamber. Typically, inoculum size represents 5–7 % thenext scaling-up volume. At the end of scaling-up, 5,000 l
of must in vigorous fermentation was used to inoculate
25,000 l of must in each vat; at this stage, prefermented
must represented 20 % ﬁnal volume. That is, four vats
containing 25,000 l were fermented at the winery from aninitial 20 l of YPD culture from the laboratory.
Industrial-scale viniﬁcationsIndustrial viniﬁcations were carried out in 38,500-l stain-
less-steel vats, each containing 30,000 l of must. Thetemperature was kept below 28 /C176C. At the end of scaling-
up, 2,500 l of must in vigorous fermentation was used to
inoculate 30,000 l of must; at this point, prefermented mustrepresented 8.3 % ﬁnal volume. All fermentations were
followed by four daily temperature and sugar content ( 8Be´)
measurements. In addition, 50-ml samples were taken fromthe middle zone in each fermenter in the course of fer-
mentation process, and were carried to the laboratory. Cell
number was estimated by microscopy using a Bu ¨rker
chamber. Serial dilutions were carried out, and samples
were plated on YPD and incubated for 3 days at 28 /C176C;
isolated colonies were randomly selected and used to per-form RAPD-PCRs intended to test presence of J4 strain.
Biological agingThe musts, fermented in pilot-scale viniﬁcations, in
30,000-l stainless-steel vats as described above, were fur-ther fortiﬁed to 15.5 % (v/v) ethanol content. For each
aging test, 249 butts from the same cellar stocks, each one
containing 12 ‘‘arrobas’’ (one ‘‘arroba’’ equals 16.66 l)wine aging under ‘‘ﬂor’’ yeasts, were ﬁlled with 15
‘‘arrobas’’ of the aforementioned fortiﬁed wine to be tested.
The mixed wine was allowed to age under the ‘‘ﬂor’’ velumnaturally occurring on the wine surface. Samples from the
middle section in each butt were taken and pooled;
glycerine, ethanol, acetaldehyde and volatile acidity contentsin mixed wine (the most important metabolites of Sherry
wine [ 26]) were measured as described above. The quality
of ‘‘ﬂor’’ velum was evaluated ‘‘de visu’’ according to threeparameters, i.e., thickness (thicker as higher quality, vs.
thinner), color (whiter as higher quality, vs. yellow brown)
and covered area (continuous as higher quality, vs. brokenor isolated) [ 25].J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol
123Results
Molecular characterization and oenological parameters
of J1, J2, J3, J4, and J5 strains
Five Saccharomyces autochthonous strains, named J1, J2,
J3, J4, and J5 were selected, as described in the ‘‘ Materials
and methods ’’ section. Strains showed karyotype patterns
characteristic of the Saccharomyces genus but different
from each other and also different with regard to referencestrains (Fig. 1a). Some RAPD-PCR proﬁles obtained were
identical for all tested strains (data not shown), but others
were useful to identify them, allowing to distinguish eachsingle strain or, alternatively, a single strain from the rest
(Fig. 1b, c).
To evaluate fermentation behavior and characterize
oenological parameters in selected strains, microviniﬁcations
were performed. All candidates reached volatile acidity
production values under wine reference C1 strain, J4 beingthe lowest producer (Table 1). All ﬁve isolated strains
showed appropriate fermentative kinetics comparable to
those obtained for reference C1 and C2 strains. The isolates
displayed similar sugar content consumption slopes,reaching an ethanol grade equal to that of reference strains
and ﬂocculating at the end of fermentation, leaving a clear
white wine (data not shown). After fermentations werecompleted, base wines were subjected to a sensory test by a
panel of experts from the winery in order to evaluate
potential use intended for Sherry production. Their fresh
and fruity character and the absence of off-ﬂavor, together
with well-balanced acidity, all of them desirable propertiesin this base wine, were evaluated; J4 strain obtained
the highest score (Table 1). The killer phenotype (K1 and
K2 biotype) of selected strains was evaluated as well(Table 1).
The ability to grow in must in the presence of increasing
amounts of SO
2was also tested at 27 and 34 /C176C. All strains
exhibited similar tolerance to concentrations below

123200 ppm of total SO 2(Fig. 2a). J2, J4, and J5 strains were
more tolerant and were capable of growing in the presence
of at least 300 ppm of total SO 2. Results were similar at the
two temperatures tested. Considering all results and inaccordance with winery criteria, J4 and J5 strains were
selected as the best starter candidates; supplementary
characterization was then performed. Fermentations con-ducted with J4, J5, and C2 reference strains were them
achieved in must at 300 ppm of total SO
2with the addi-
tional stress of higher temperature (34 /C176C) or lower tem-
perature (25 /C176C) (Fig. 2b). At 25 /C176C, all strains were able
to exhaust sugar content, albeit C2 reference strain was
faster. At 34 /C176C, only J5 strain was able to exhaust sugar,
whereas J4 and C2 strains had about 5 % remaining fer-
mentable sugar.
New microviniﬁcation assays were also conducted with
J4 and J5 strains and for C1 and C2 reference strains. At
the end of fermentation, these Sherry base wines werestored at 4 /C176C and, after discarding deposited sediments,
some physicochemical parameters and volatile compoundswere determined (Table 2). Data show a representative
example: different must batches could yield quantitative
differences between assays, but qualitative differences
among strains were always repetitive. Although the C1reference strain showed the highest acetaldehyde concen-
tration, the J4 strain always rendered high acetaldehyde,
together with lowest volatile acid ﬁnal content.
Subsequently, desiccation tolerance tests of J4 and J5
strains were carried out in order to try their potential use as
active dried yeast, since J4 and J5 isolates may be usedas fermentation starters. Strains C1 and C2 were used as
reference strains. C2 strain is routinely commercialized as
active dried yeast. The recovery percentage of viable cellsfrom J4 and J5 strains after desiccation and rehydration
moved in the same range as that of C2 strain (Table 1).
Pilot-scale fermentations
During the 2008 vintage, four pilot fermentations in
30,000-l vats were conducted with J4 and J5 candidates as
starter strains. Kinetics fermentation behavior was checked
by four daily temperature and sugar content measurementsall through the scaling phases. Average sugar content

kinetics for J4 and J5 were better than that obtained for
commercial C2 reference strain. Other interesting oeno-
logical parameters were determined at the end of fermen-tations. Since J4 and J5 strains were previously selected
from spontaneous fermentations, data of a spontaneous
fermentation are shown as well (Table 3). The J4 and J5
strains obtained similar values for oenological parameters.
The J4 strain reached the highest alcoholic grade at the end
of fermentation.
Behavior under biological aging
These Sherry base wines fermented in pilot scales during
the 2008 vintage by J4, J5, and C2 strains were further
fortiﬁed (15.5 % v/v ethanol content) and subjected tonormal biological aging process for Sherry wines, accord-
ing to the ‘‘solera’’ system [ 5]. The wines were then sub-
jected for 18 months to biological aging under the naturallydeveloped ‘‘ﬂor’’ velum. Wine samples from butts were
taken; some oenological parameters were determined, and
the dynamic development of ‘‘ﬂor’’ velum (types and fre-quencies) was evaluated ‘‘de visu’’ (Table 4). Three types
of ‘‘ﬂor’’ velum qualities (A, B and C) were observed:
continuous, white and thick ‘‘ﬂor’’ velum (type A, highestquality); continuous, white but thinner ‘‘ﬂor’’ velum (typeB, medium quality); and broken or absent ‘‘ﬂor’’ velum
(type C, poorest quality). Type A, which is less common
after summer, was predominant in all cases. Such seasonal
‘‘ﬂor’’ velum behavior is common in this winegrowingarea. After 18 months, as a result of ‘‘ﬂor’’ yeast metabo-
lism, wines reduced glycerine content, volatile acidity
content and ethanol content, as expected. In addition,acetaldehyde content, responsible for the distinctive aroma
of ‘‘Fino’’, increased (Table 4). All those parameters
indicate correct ‘‘ﬂor’’ velum formation (in spite of J4
and J5 strains being k2) and excellent organoleptic char-
acteristics under biological aging in these Sherry basewines.
Industrial-scale viniﬁcationsAs a result, during the 2009–2010 vintages, strain J4 was
selected to perform industrial viniﬁcations in cellar withvats of similar capacity to those of pilot-scale viniﬁcations,
but increasing considerably vat number. In 2009, the best-
quality non-sterile musts were fermented with J4 candidatestrain and with C2 reference strain. A total of 350,000 l of
wine was produced with the C2 strain, and 950,000 l with
the J4 strain. Analytical parameters measured at the end offermentation are summarized in Table 5. Those Sherry
base wines were further tested by a panel of testers from
the winery. Wines elaborated with J4 were better evaluatedby testers than those obtained with commercial C2 strain.
As a result, since 2010 vintage, the J4 strain was selected to
routinely ferment the best-quality musts at the cellar.Analytical parameters measured at the end of fermentation
in 2010 vintage are summarized in Table 5, as well. The
base wines obtained were excellent and rather similar tothose from 2009 vintage.
Prevalence of J4 strain under industrial fermentationTo prove the prevalence of inoculated J4 strain under
industrial conditions, samples from industrial fermentation,conducted with J4 strain as starter, were taken and

123Alcoholic fermentation behavior was evaluated daily by
8Be´measurement. The presence of J4 inoculated strain was
evaluated from samples taken all through the fermentation
process. For this purpose, RAPD-PCRs analyses withOPA-10 primer were carried out; DNA was extracted from
50 colonies randomly selected from each sample (Table 6).
J4 was the predominant strain during vigorous fermentationin the inoculated vat. Some physicochemical parameters
and volatile compounds were also determined at the end
of fermentations (Table 6). Data show a representative
example: different must batches could render quantitativedifferences among fermentations, carried out spontaneously
or by the different strains, but qualitative differences were
repetitive. Similar values for mainly oenological parameters
were reached. In addition, acetaldehyde content in theinoculated vats reached a considerable high value.
From data obtained and in accordance with results, J4
strain seems to be the best candidate to conduct alcoholicfermentations and produce Sherry base wine; it was chosen
by the wine company to produce base Sherry white wine
for the elaboration of commercial Sherry wine since 2010
vintage.Table 4 Dynamic development and metabolism of the ‘‘ﬂor’’ velum naturally occurring on Sherry wines, previously fermented by either C2, J4,

123Discussion
In the last few decades, the tendency to apply commercial
active dried yeasts in non-Sherry producing wineries hasbecome widespread [ 17,42,44]. In addition, in recent
times, the efforts are directed to select an appropriate
indigenous yeast to perform alcoholic fermentation. Someexploratory studies in other different fortiﬁed wines are
emerging [ 35], but to the best of our knowledge, none of
those studies have been carried out in Sherry-producingcellars, although some Sherry-producing companies are
investigating the use of selected strains of S. cerevisiae to
conduct alcoholic fermentation. In ‘‘Fino’’ production, palefermented and low acidity musts exhibit the best qualities.
The mechanical harvest method applied over the last
few decades partially favors the development of non-Saccharomyces yeasts that increase ﬁnal acidity content,
hence, the need to select a yeast starter capable of toler-
ating a fairly high concentration of sulphite, and in addition
producing low volatile acidity ﬁnal content and highacetaldehyde.
Five Saccharomyces strains from those isolated at the
end of spontaneous fermentations in the Sherrywinemaking area were selected and characterized in this
study. The selection of yeasts at the end of spontaneous
fermentations brings about isolate local strains that present
high fermentative power and tolerance, well adjusted to the
speciﬁc oenological practices of a region or a particularcellar and winemaking area [ 32]. The fermentative
behavior in laboratory conditions of the isolates was
appropriate, comparable to those of the reference strains.The J4 strain, capable of tolerating a fairly high concen-
tration of sulphite, showed the lowest volatile acidity
together with high acetaldehyde content, but since labora-tory-scale experiences do not always mimic industrial
scale, pilot and industrial fermentations were also per-
formed. In fact, highly clariﬁed must fermentation kineticsand metabolite synthesis are strongly affected by the
experiment scale [ 9]. Although the Sherry must intended
for ‘‘Fino’’ production is a highly clariﬁed must, the can-didates tested behaved as expected in non-sterile pilot
fermentations and the results were promising.
The indigenous J4 strain was selected over the rest and
was tested under industrial conditions; the inoculated strain
was the most abundant yeast in the course of the vigorous
fermentation (56–68 %), where metabolic activity is max-imal, and so it became the principal alcoholic fermentation
agent; ﬂocculation may account for the low percentage of J4
at the end of fermentation. At the cellar where the study wasconducted, musts can reach high temperatures (under
30/C176C) before and during transfer to fermentation vats, thus
allowing musts to partially ferment. For this reason, somenatural microorganisms grow, and the inoculated strain has
to coexist with other species. The development of Saccha-
romyces and non- Saccharomyces species at the beginning
of fermentation could be desirable, as it provides com-
plexity to the resulting wine [ 13,39]. However, as data
show, the J4 strain prevailed during vigorous fermentationprocess. Inoculum size and must state, together with strain
competence abilities, can be essential to determine which
species are predominant. Variations in inoculum protocolcould modulate propagation of starter strains, as has been
suggested [ 33]. In our experience, the volume of inoculum
size was 8.3 % ﬁnal volume in industrial fermentation,allowing the J4 strain to conduct alcoholic fermentation,
apart from coexisting with natural microbiota, thus ren-
dering a low volatile acidity and high acetaldehyde ﬁnalcontent base wine. A similar percentage of J4 at the end of
inoculated and spontaneous fermentations may be due to theTable 6 Detection (%) of J4 strain during fermentation process and

bDifferent batches give rise to quantitative differences in absolute

123fact that J4 is a resident strain of the cellar. This suggestion
is based on two facts, namely its isolation from local
spontaneous fermentation and its prevalence throughout
several vintage fermentations.
Nevertheless, the ultimate goal for a Sherry base wine
produced by Sherry wine manufacturers is biological
aging, which is carried out under a natural ‘‘ﬂor’’ velumformed on the wine surface by the so-called ‘‘ﬂor’’ yeasts
[24,26]. All fermentative autochthonous yeasts tested in
this work were tolerant to K2 toxin, and all but one were
producers. Furthermore, viability of the J4 strain was
11–12 % after fortifying the wine to 15.5 % ethanol priorto aging (data not shown). The Sherry base wine elaborated
with the selected strain is further subjected to the regular
biological aging of Sherry wines. Stocks are under bio-logical aging and results point to an excellent ‘‘ﬂor’’ velum
formation. Therefore, the killer phenotype in the selected
fermentative strain does not interfere either with sub-sequent indigenous ‘‘ﬂor’’ yeast development or with
‘‘ﬂor’’ velum formation, which occurs at low temperature
and pH, optimal for the toxin to be active, probablybecause some ‘‘ﬂor’’ yeasts are K2 resistant [ 22] or because
the toxin may not be active at such ethanol concentrations.
Desiccation tolerance of J4 and J5 indigenous strains has
been tested too, and it has proved to be similar to that of
commercial C2 strain. This fact opens the possibility to
store and use indigenous strains as commercial driedyeasts.
The J4 strain is currently being used routinely to ferment
Palomino musts with a commercial purpose.
