With growing demand for bio-based fuels and chemicals, there has been much attention given to the per-
formance of different feedstocks. We have optimized the ammonia ﬁber expansion (AFEX) pretreatment
and fermentation process to convert forage and sweet sorghum bagasse to ethanol. AFEX pretreatment
was optimized for forage sorghum and sweet sorghum bagasse. Supplementing xylanase with cellulaseduring enzymatic hydrolysis increased both glucan and xylan conversion to 90% at 1% glucan loading. Highsolid loading hydrolyzates from the optimized AFEX conditions were fermented using Saccharomyces cere-
visiae 424A (LNH-ST) without any external nutrient supplementation or detoxiﬁcation. The strain was bet-
ter able to utilize xylose at pH 6.0 than at pH 4.8, but glycerol production was higher for the former pH thanthe latter. The maximum ﬁnal ethanol concentration in the fermentation broth was 30.9 g/L (forage sor-
ghum) and 42.3 g/L (sweet sorghum bagasse). A complete mass balance for the process is given.

1. Introduction
The development of alternatives to fossil fuels is receiving in-
creased attention as it becomes an urgent global priority due to
the growing concern over the effect of green house gases on the
environment and security of the global liquid fuel supply (Rubin,
2008 ). Cellulosic ethanol could be a key alternative fuel, but several
types of feedstocks that grow well in different climatic conditionsare needed to make this fuel source viable. C4 plants, such as corn
(Zea mays L.), sorghum ( Sorghum sp.) and sugarcane ( Saccharum
sp.), are promising candidates for energy plants because of theirhigh photosynthetic efﬁciency and higher biomass yield per hect-
are (Rubin, 2008 ). Based on a recent economic analysis, sweet sor-
ghum is considered to be one of the most drought resistant cropsand has higher biomass yield and lower production costs than
many other plants ( Corredor et al., 2009 ). Forage sorghum, which
is typically grown for animal feed as silage, has a very short grow-ing period (about 60 days), much shorter than the growing period
required for corn or other kinds of sorghum (no less than
120 days), including grain sorghum and sweet sorghum (Table 1 ).
Research has provided some basis for improving the sugar con-
tent in sweet sorghum by controlling the planting conditions
(Almodares and Sharif, 2007 ). Solid-state fermentation of sweetsorghum stems has been developed due to their high sugar content
(Gibbons et al., 1986; Kargi et al., 1985; Kargi and Curme, 1985; Yu
et al., 2008 ). However, scale-up of solid-state fermentation is at a
bottleneck because of engineering problems associated with the
process ( Holker and Lenz, 2005 ). Another approach to utilizing
sweet sorghum is processing the harvested plant into juice and ba-gasse. Sweet sorghum juice contains high concentrations of sugar
and could be used directly as a substrate for ethanol production.
Liu and Shen showed promising results for the conversion of sweet
sorghum juice to ethanol by immobilized yeast cells (Liu and Shen,
2008 ). Due to the similarity between sweet sorghum and sugar-
cane, large scale industrial bio-reﬁneries producing ethanol fromsweet sorghum juice can learn much from sugarcane-based etha-
nol production. A huge amount of sweet sorghum bagasse will re-
sult from the large scale production of sweet sorghum juice. There
are several techniques to utilizing sweet sorghum bagasse such as
burning, converting to methane and converting to ethanol (Gnan-
sounou et al., 2005; Stamatelatou et al., 2003 ).
Ammonia ﬁber expansion (AFEX) is one of the most promising
pretreatment methods for lignocellulosic biomass when compared
to other leading pretreatment processes (Eggeman and Elander,
2005 ). AFEX pretreatment is a dry-to-dry process (i.e., there is no
liquid stream produced during pretreatment) which makes it quitedifferent from and potentially less costly than other pretreatment
methods, such as dilute-acid and steam-explosion. Recent research
indicates that AFEX pretreatment also has the potential to reduce
the mean ethanol selling price by about 60% below previous

estimates ( Sendich et al., 2008 ). AFEX pretreatment has led to
higher conversions of several different kinds of cellulosic biomass,
including corn stover ( Teymouri et al., 2005 ), switchgrass ( Ali-
zadeh et al., 2005 ),Miscanthus (Chinese silver grass) (Murnen
et al., 2007 ) and rice straw ( Balan et al., 2008 ).
The objective of this paper is to optimize the bioreﬁning process
for both forage sorghum and sweet sorghum bagasse, including
AFEX pretreatment, hydrolysis using commercial enzymes and eth-
anol fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae 424A (LNH-ST)
without any external nutrient supplementation or detoxiﬁcation.
2. Methods
2.1. Biomass source
Whole forage sorghum was received from Florida, USA. Sweet
sorghum was from Binzhou in Shandong Province, China. Sweet
sorghum stems were stripped from the leaves and squeezed by a
three-roller mill in Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering in
Tianjin University. The residual bagasse was dried until the mois-
ture content was between 5% and 10% based on the total weight.
Both forage sorghum and sweet sorghum bagasse were ground
using a Wiley mill with a 5-mm diameter sieve and then stored
at 4/C176C in zip-lock bags until further use.
2.2. Washing protocol
In order to remove residual soluble sugars from sweet sorghum
bagasse, about 400 mL of water was used to wash 100 g of dry ba-gasse three times. The washed biomass was squeezed by hand
using cheese cloth to remove residual water. Then the bagasse
was placed under a fume hood until the moisture content ap-
proached 120% (dry weight basis; all moisture percentages were
based on dry weight throughout the study). The wash stream
was collected and stored at /C020/C176C until further use.
2.3. Composition analysis
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) LAP-004 pro-
tocol was used to determine the composition of biomass and extrac-
tives ( http://www.nrel.gov/biomass/analytical_procedures.html ).
2.4. AFEX pretreatment
For quick optimization of AFEX pretreatment conditions, exper-
iments were done in parallel 22-mL stainless steel reactors accord-ing to the method outlined previously by Teymouri et al. (2005) .
Large scale AFEX pretreatment for fermentation experiments wasconducted in a 2-L stainless steel reactor. AFEX pretreated biomass
was kept under the fume hood overnight to remove residual
ammonia, and then stored at 4 /C176C until further use.
2.5. Enzymatic hydrolysis
The NREL standard protocol (LAP-009) was followed for enzy-
matic hydrolysis. Both commercial cellulase (Spezyme CP) and
xylanase (Multifect xylanase) were generous gifts from Genencor
(Palo Alto, CA). A b-glucosidase (Novo 188) was purchased from
Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Experiments at 1% glucan loadingwere conducted with 15-mL reaction volume in 20-mL scintillation
vials, with the necessary commercial cellulase (31.3 mg/g glucan)
andb-glucosidase (17.1 mg/g glucan) at 50 /C176C and 150 rpm. About
0.05 M citrate buffer (pH 4.8) with 30 mg/L cycloheximide and40 mg/L tetracycline were used in enzymatic hydrolysis. Certain
samples were also hydrolyzed using additional commercial xylan-
ases (0–32.2 mg/g glucan). The samples were taken during enzy-
matic hydrolysis as previously described in Balan et al. (2008) .
The samples were frozen at /C020/C176C for subsequent HPLC sugar
analysis. The protein concentrations of the enzymes were deter-mined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The protein
concentrations of the respective enzymes were as follows: Spe-
zyme CP (123 mg/mL; 59 FPU/mL; where FPU stands for ﬁlter pa-
per units), b-glucosidase (67 mg/mL; 250 pNPGU/mL; pNPGU
stands forp-nitrophenyl
-glucoside units), and Multifect xylanase
(42 mg/mL).
High solid loading enzymatic hydrolysis prior to fermentation
and the mass balance experiments were conducted in 2000 or
250 mL ﬂasks, respectively. High solid loading enzymatic hydroly-
sis was performed with 40 mg/L tetracycline addition, at 50 /C176C and
at pH 4.8 with 250 rpm shaking. Half of the biomass and enzymeswere used to start the hydrolysis, with the second half added into
the ﬂask after 3 h. Cellulase was supplemented with xylanase as
described above. The hydrolyzate was ﬁltered against a 0.2
lm ﬁl-
ter prior to fermentation.
The glucan and xylan conversion was calculated based on the
theoretical sugar release from biomass, i.e., 1.11 g glucose/g glucanand 1.14 g xylose/g xylan.

Department of Agriculture.1286 B.-Z. Li et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 1285–1292University, was used to ferment sweet sorghum bagasse and forage
sorghum hydrolyzates.
A single colony of S. cerevisiae 424A (LNH-ST) was picked from a
YEPD-Agar plate (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, 50 g/L glu-
cose, and 20 g/L agar), inoculated into a 250-mL ﬂask with 50-mL
YEPD media (10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone and 50 g/L glu-
cose), and incubated overnight at 150 rpm and 30 /C176C as the seed
for fermentation.
The fermentation was carried out in 250-mL ﬂasks with 60-mL
hydrolyzate at 150 rpm and 30 /C176C. The initial cell density of the fer-
mentation was OD600 = 0.5 (about 0.275 g dry cell/L). The fermen-
tation broth was sampled (0.9 mL) at regular intervals to
determine cell density, sugar and ethanol present in the broth.
All the fermentation experiments were done without any external
nutrient supplementation or detoxiﬁcation. Ethanol yield was esti-mated based on total consumed sugars. The theoretical maximum
yield was 0.51 g EtOH/g sugar.
2.7. Monomeric sugar and ethanol analysis using HPLC
Sugar and ethanol analysis was performed using a HPLC-RI
detector system. This system consisted of a Waters (Milford, MA)
515 Pump connected to a Waters 410 refractive index detector.
An Aminex HPX-87P carbohydrate analysis column (Bio-rad, Her-
cules, CA) equipped with a deashing guard cartridge (Bio-rad)
was used for quantifying sugars in hydrolyzate. Degassed HPLC
grade water was used as the mobile phase at 0.6 mL/min at a col-
umn temperature of 85 /C176C. The injection volume was 10
lL with a
run time of 20 min. An Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-rad) wasused to quantify both sugar and ethanol concentrations for fer-
mentation samples and acid hydrolyzed samples. The temperature
of the HPX-87H column was maintained at 50 /C176C. The mobile phase
used for this column was 5 mM sulfuric acid (H
2SO4) at a ﬂow rate
of 0.6 mL/min.
2.8. Error analysis
The hydrolysis and fermentation were performed in duplicate,
and the composition analysis was done in triplicate. Error bars rep-
resent the standard deviation of the replicates. For all signiﬁcance
tests, a student t-test was used requiring a probability p< 0.05 to
be signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Composition analysis
Both forage and sweet sorghum bagasse were extracted with
water and 95% ethanol using an ASE2000 (Accelerated Solvent
Extractor, DIONEX, CA) to remove extractives before acid hydroly-
sis. HPLC results showed that there were no free monomeric sugars
in the extractives for forage sorghum, while a considerable amount
of monomeric sugar was found in sweet sorghum bagasse (Fig. 1 ).
The composition analysis (Table 2 ) showed 35.6% and 38.3% of glu-
can and 18.4% and 18.2% of xylan for forage and washed sweet sor-
ghum bagasse, respectively.
3.2. Effect of sweet sorghum bagasse washing and AFEX pretreatment
After AFEX pretreatment the free glucose content decreased to
1.5 from 5 g/L, which indicates that free monomeric sugars were
degraded to other products during pretreatment (Fig. 1 A). High
concentrations of free sugars were found in unwashed sweet sor-ghum bagasse due to residual sugar left after removing sugar juice
from the stems. The free sugar was subsequently removed usingtriple water washing. About fourfold increases in both glucanand xylan conversion could be seen in AFEX treated washed sweet
sorghum bagasse samples when compared to untreated washed
samples. These results indicate that AFEX pretreatment facilitates
enzymatic hydrolysis and enhances glucan/xylan conversion in
the hydrolysis ( Bradshaw et al., 2007; Teymouri et al., 2005 ).
3.3. Optimization of AFEX conditions
Four parameters for AFEX pretreatment were varied in the opti-
mization of the conditions for both sweet sorghum bagasse and
forage sorghum, including: biomass moisture content, the ratio
of ammonia to dry biomass loading, reaction temperature, and res-
idence time. The glucan/xylan conversion of untreated sweet sor-
ghum bagasse and forage sorghum was very low; 9.9% and 21.8%
glucan conversion and 6.6% and 13.1% xylan conversion, respec-
tively. For both sweet sorghum bagasse and forage sorghum, AFEX
pretreatment signiﬁcantly increases the monomeric sugars after
enzymatic hydrolysis. In addition, glucan/xylan conversions were
consistently higher at 2:1 ammonia to biomass loading than at
1:1 loading.
Fig. 1. The effect of AFEX pretreatment on sweet sorghum bagasse before (A) and
after (B) washing. Hydrolysis experiments were done at 50 /C176C and 150 rpm using 1%
glucan loading with 31.3 mg cellulase/g glucan and 17.1 mg b-glucosidase/g glucan.
The corresponding glucose concentration (white shade) and xylose concentration
(gray shade) after 72 h in the hydrolysates are shown. Here, UT-NE, untreated
sample without enzymes loading; UT-E, untreated sample with enzymes loading;AFEX-NE, AFEX treated sample without enzymes loading; AFEX-E, AFEX treatedsample with enzymes loading. AFEX condition was 2:1 ammonia loading to biomassloading, 120% moisture content and 140 /C176C for 5 min. Standard deviations are
calculated based on duplicate experiments.B.-Z. Li et al. / Bioresource Technology 101 (2010) 1285–1292 1287For washed sweet sorghum bagasse, by varying AFEX pretreat-
ment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis (31.3 mg/g glucan of cellu-
lase, 17.1 mg/g glucan of b-glucosidase, 50 /C176C, 150 rpm, 1% glucan
loading), it was found that there was no signiﬁcant increase in glu-can/xylan conversion beyond 2:1 ammonia to biomass loading and
beyond 120% moisture. On the other hand, increasing the pretreat-
ment temperature from 100 to 140 /C176C increases both glucan and
xylan conversions signiﬁcantly. The residence time had very littleimpact on both glucan and xylan conversions. Based on these
experiments, the optimal AFEX conditions for washed sweet sor-
ghum bagasse are 120% moisture content, 2:1 ammonia to biomass
loading, 140 /C176C and 30 min residence time. Under these conditions,
glucan and xylan conversion reached about 80% and 90%, respec-tively, during enzyme hydrolysis.
For forage sorghum, three different temperatures (100, 120 and
140/C176C) and three different moisture contents (60%, 120% and 233%)
were used for two different ammonia to biomass loading (1:1 and2:1) conditions. At 1:1 ammonia to dry biomass loading, glucan/xy-
lan conversions after enzymatic hydrolysis were higher at 60%
moisture, while, at 2:1 ammonia loading, glucan/xylan conversions
were highest at 120% moisture. This difference could be due to the
chemical reaction that occurs between ammonia and water during
the pretreatment process. At 2:1 ammonia loading, higher glucan
conversions were obtained at the higher temperature (140 /C176C),
but at low ammonia loading, the effect of temperature was not sopronounced and seemed to depend on the moisture content. Based
on both glucan and xylan conversions, the optimal AFEX conditions
for forage sorghum were 2:1 ammonia to biomass loading, 120%
moisture, 140 /C176C and 5 min for residence time.
3.4. Optimization of xylanase loading
Using standard enzymatic hydrolysis conditions (31.3 mg/g glu-
can of cellulase and 17.1 mg/g glucan of b-glucosidase), the effect
of xylanase loading on glucan/xylan conversion was investigated
at 1% glucan loading with different xylanase loadings (0, 7.8, 15.6
and 32.2 mg/g glucan). Based on proteomic analysis and activity
assays we found that there is very little xylanase in Spezyme CP
(data not shown). Previous reports have shown that adding xylan-
ase to cellulase improved both glucan and xylan conversion (Chun-
dawat et al., 2007 ). For AFEX-treated forage sorghum samples,
varying the xylanase loading improved both the glucan and xylanconversion by about 3% and 7%, respectively.
3.5. Fermentation of hydrolyzates
Fermentation results for both sweet sorghum bagasse and for-
age sorghum are summarized in Table 3 . The concentrations of glu-
cose, xylose, ethanol and glycerol in the fermentation broth as a
function of time are given in Fig. 2 . For sweet sorghum bagasse,
only hydrolyzate with 6% glucan loading was used and ethanol fer-mentation was performed using S. cerevisiae at pH 6.0 with andwithout the water wash stream ( Fig. 2 IA and IB). For forage sor-
ghum, two different hydrolyzates were prepared for fermentation
(1% or 6% glucan loading) and ethanol fermentations were done
at two different pH (4.8 and 6.0) conditions (Fig. 2 IIA-D).
In the case of sweet sorghum bagasse, the initial glucose con-
centration in the hydrolyzates was 54.3 g/L without the wash
stream and 66.6 g/L with the wash stream. The volume recovery
of the hydrolyzate with 6% glucan loading after centrifugation
was 79% (v/v). The supernatant was removed from unhydrolyzed
solids by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 30 min. The glucan and
xylan conversions at 6% glucan loading were found to be 64.5%
and 74.3% (without wash stream) and 66% and 82.4% (with wash
stream), respectively. The ﬁnal concentration of ethanol without
the wash stream was 29.4 g/L, while it was 42.3 g/L with wash
stream. The xylose utilization during fermentation was found tobe 55.6% (with wash stream) and 51.3% (without wash stream).
Glycerol, one of the side products, was also found in the fermenta-
tion broth and tended to increase as a function of time. However,
the amount of xylitol produced in the fermentation broth with
the wash stream was greater than the amount produced without
the wash stream. It is interesting to note that cell density in the
hydrolysis with the wash stream was higher than the one without
the wash stream ( Fig. 3 A). One can see a logarithmic increase in
cell density in the ﬁrst 24 h, after which it levels off. As we can
see in Fig.2,
 glucose was consumed within the ﬁrst 24 h of fermen-
tation while it took a longer time for the xylose to be consumed.
The ethanol yield was found to be 96.9% (for hydrolyzate with
wash stream) and 82.2% (for hydrolyzate without wash stream).
For forage sorghum hydrolyzates, the ﬁnal ethanol concentra-
tions were found to be 3.9 g/L (1% glucan loading, pH 4.8), 30.3 g/
L (6% glucan loading, pH 4.8), 4.1 g/L (1% glucan loading, pH 6.0)
and 30.9 g/L (6% glucan loading, pH 6.0) (Fig. 2IIA and B). Here
again, glucose was consumed within the ﬁrst 12 h (1% glucan load-ing) and 24 h (6% glucan loading) during the fermentation of
hydrolyzates, while it took longer to consume xylose. Glycerol
was also produced during fermentation and the ﬁnal concentration
of glycerol was higher at pH 6.0 than that at pH 4.8. About 40%
more glycerol was produced during fermentation at pH 6.0 than
that at pH 4.8.
Cell density was found to be higher at pH 6.0 when compared to
pH 4.8 for 6% glucan loading hydrolyzates, while no signiﬁcant dif-
ference was noticed for the 1% glucan loading hydrolyzates
(Fig. 3 B). For 6% glucan loading hydrolyzates, unutilized xylose lev-
els were about 17.7 g/L (pH 4.8) and 13.0 g/L (pH 6.0) (i.e., onlyabout 40% of the available xylose was consumed in the fermenta-
tion at pH 4.8, while more than 50% of the available xylose was
consumed at pH 6.0).
3.6. Mass balance
A mass balance was developed for the complete conversion of
both sweet sorghum bagasse and forage sorghum to ethanol based
on enzymatic hydrolysis at 6% glucan loading (Fig. 4 ). There is no
evident mass loss during AFEX pretreatment, which is a dry-to-dry process. The conversions during enzymatic hydrolysis for for-
age sorghum were 74% for glucan and 73% for xylan; 29.2 g of glu-
cose and 15.2 g of xylose were obtained with 6% glucan loading
using 100 g of AFEX-treated forage sorghum. The initial cell density
ofS. cerevisiae in the fermentation was OD600 = 0.5. The ethanol
concentration produced from the fermentation was 30.8 g/L at96 h. After 96 h of inoculation, all of the glucose and 53% of the xy-
lose was consumed. From 100 g of dry forage sorghum, 17.1 g eth-
anol was produced, giving a 90.0% ethanol yield from the
fermentation ( Fig. 4 A).
The conversion for sweet sorghum bagasse enzymatic hydroly-
sis was 67% for glucan and 76% for xylan without wash stream whileTable 2

4. Discussion
4.1. AFEX pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis
AFEX is an efﬁcient pretreatment method that improves the su-
gar release from cellulose and hemicellulose (Chundawat et al.,
2007 ). For forage sorghum, the glucan conversion after enzymatic
hydrolysis was 80% for AFEX-treated biomass and 20% for untreatedmaterial. Xylan conversion increased to 83% for treated biomass
from 13% for the untreated material. Similar improvements for glu-
can/xylan conversion were also found for other types of biomass,
such as corn stover, switchgrass, Miscanthus , rice straw, reed canary-
grass and distillers’ grains ( Alizadeh et al., 2005; Balan et al., 2008;
Bradshaw et al., 2007; Murnen et al., 2007; Teymouri et al., 2005 ).
The optimal AFEX conditions for forage sorghum and sweet sorghumbagasse were not the same as those for other biomass types, which
can be explained by variation in composition as well as differences
in the lignin/cellulose/hemicellulose matrix structure. Further stud-ies are necessary to determine the precise reasons for these differ-ences in optimal conditions. Sweet sorghum bagasse contained
free sugars which were found to be destroyed during AFEX pretreat-
ment. Washing the biomass prior to AFEX pretreatment was an efﬁ-
cient way to remove the free sugars in sweet sorghum bagasse.
Different types of biomass have different cell wall structures
with different architectures of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin
(Mosier et al., 2005 ). Even for the same type of biomass, many fac-
tors can affect the composition of the biomass, such as growth per-iod, environmental conditions (pH, temperature, availability of
sunlight and rain), and storage conditions (Bradshaw et al., 2007;
Weimer and Springer, 2007 ). Because of these differences, the ratios
of the enzymes needed during hydrolysis can vary with the type ofbiomass. The most widely-used enzymes for hydrolysis of cellulose
are commercial enzymes such as the enzymes used here: SpezymeCP, Novozym 188, and Multifect xylanase. These enzymes are not
pure enzymes, but a mixture of several enzymes including varying
amounts of cellulases and hemicellulases. The amount of xylanase
in Spezyme CP is relatively low and supplementation of xylanase
is necessary in order to improve xylan conversion (Chundawat
et al., 2007 ). When xylanase was added to the hydrolysis system
along with the cellulase enzymes, the glucan conversion was in-creased by about 7%. The increase in glucan conversion may also
be due to synergistic effects between cellulase, b-glucosidase, and
xylanase ( Murashima et al., 2003; Kumar and Wyman, 2009 ).
4.2. Ethanol fermentation
S. cerevisiae 424A (LNH-ST) has been shown to be an excellent
strain for cellulosic ethanol production (Govindaswamy and Vane,2007; Lau and Dale, 2009; Zhong et al., 2009 ) because of its ability
to consume both glucose and xylose during anaerobic fermenta-tion. We used this strain to ferment the hydrolyzates from AFEX-
treated forage and sweet sorghum bagasse without any external
nutrient supplementation or detoxiﬁcation. It is very important
to keep the pH within the optimal range for yeast during the fer-
mentation. We found that the production of glycerol, the main
by-product in glucose consumption, was higher at pH 6.0 than at
pH 4.8. It was shown in earlier work that higher pH could stimulate
the biosynthesis of glycerol ( Ingledew, 1999 ). The optimal pH for
xylose utilization was not the same as that for glucose fermenta-tion. Higher xylose conversion was observed at pH 6.0 than at pH
4.8, as reported in previous work ( Sedlak and Ho, 2004 ). Although
xylose conversion was much higher at pH 6.0, ethanol concentra-tion only increased slightly ( Table 3 ). This was due to increased
glycerol production in the glucose consumption stage. More re-search is needed to ﬁnd an optimal pH point for maximum ethanolproduction from both glucose and xylose consumption.
In the fermentation of hydrolyzates at 1% glucan loading, xylose
was almost completely consumed at both pH 4.8 and pH 6.0
(Fig. 2 IIA and B). This indicates that this strain has a very good abil-
ity to utilize glucose and xylose. For the hydrolyzates from 6% glu-can loading, however, a high xylose concentration remained at the
end of fermentation. The consumption curves for xylose show that
the rate of xylose consumption following the glucose disappear-
ance decreased as the fermentation progressed. These results agree
with previously
reported results (Lau and Dale 2009; Sedlak and
Ho, 2004 ).
One possible reason for the incomplete xylose utilization may
be inhibitors in the fermentation broth. Degradation products pro-duced during AFEX pretreatment, such as various phenolic acids,
are present in lower concentrations compared to other pretreat-
ment methods, but they may still have negative effects on the fer-
mentation (unpublished results). Additionally, ethanol is also
known to inhibit the microorganism (Dasari et al., 1990).036912

tion was done using AFEX treated sweet sorghum bagasse hydroly-
zate with wash stream. Many researchers believe that hydrolyzates
from biomass are not a rich media for microorganisms (Kadam and
Newman, 1997 ) and have added different nutrients to supplement
the fermentation ( Kim et al., 2006; Klinke et al., 2003; Okuda et al.,
2007 ). Our experiments have shown that this is not true; most bio-
mass contains adequate nutrients but harsh pretreatments (suchas dilute-acid) and subsequent washing destroy or remove these
nutrients. AFEX does not destroy these nutrients, so fermentation
experiments using AFEX-treated biomass can be performed with-
out any external nutrient supplementation.
The genetic backgrounds of sweet sorghum and forage sorghum
are quite different, and these genetic differences might affect the
chemical components of the biomass and theoretic ethanol yield
(Shaug and Lo, 1997; Tew et al., 2008 ). Therefore, the differences
in the optimal AFEX conditions and fermentation performancefor the two kind feed stocks are reasonable.
4.3. Mass balance
From the mass balance, it is clear that glucan/xylan conversion
during enzymatic hydrolysis and the utilization of xylose during
ethanol fermentation were the limiting steps during conversion
of both sweet sorghum bagasse and forage sorghum to ethanol.
Glucan/xylan conversion during enzymatic hydrolysis depends onthe pretreatment conditions and enzymes used in the hydrolysis
(Eijsink et al., 2008 ). Although sorghum was treated using effective
pretreatment conditions, a better cocktail of enzymes is needed in
order to get higher conversion of glucan and xylan (Berlin et al.,
2007; Zhang et al., 2006 ). Although glucose and xylose were uti-
lized by S. cerevisiae 424A (LNH-ST) during the fermentation, the
rate of xylose consumption is much slower than that of glucose.
In conclusion, a complete process for producing ethanol from
forage and sweet sorghum bagasse has been reported in this work.
AFEX conditions for forage sorghum and sweet sorghum bagasse,
enzyme loading during hydrolysis and pH in fermentation were
optimized in this work. The yeast strain S. cerevisiae 424A (LNH-
ST) was used in the fermentation of hydrolyzates from AFEX-trea-ted forage and sweet sorghum bagasse without nutrient supple-
mentation or detoxiﬁcation. Wash stream from sweet sorghum
bagasse was proved to be an efﬁcient supplementation for the fer-
mentation of the hydrolyzates from cellulosic biomass. Xylose con-
sumption was slow and not complete during fermentation and
further microbial improvements are needed to consume both glu-
cose and xylose rapidly and completely.
