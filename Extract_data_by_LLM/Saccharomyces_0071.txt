Abstract Fossil fuels are still major energy sources, but
the search for renewable energy sources has been encour-
aged. Bioethanol has been recognized as an alternative to
fossil fuels and nowadays it represents more than 90% of
the global biofuel production. Bioethanol production from
raw sugar beet cossettes as a semi-solid substrate was
studied. The study was carried out in the horizontal rotating
tubular bioreactor (HRTB) with Saccharomyces cerevisiae
as a microbial production strain. The impact of different
combinations of HRTB operational parameters such as,
rotation speed (5–15 min-1), rotation type [constant or
interval (3–15 min h-1)] and working volume (ratio VW/
VT=0.2–0.7) on the bioethanol production was examined.
In this study, the highest bioprocess efﬁciency parame-
ters ( YP1=S=0.47 g g-1,E=87.36% and Pr =0.618
gL-1h-1) were observed at 0.20 VW/VT, interval rotation
of 12 min h-1and rotation speed of 15 min-1. It has to be
pointed out that bioethanol production efﬁciency in the
HRTB was on the similar level as observed by bioethanol
production from the raw sugar beet juice. Naturally present
microorganisms of sugar beet could have a signiﬁcant
impact on bioethanol production. Higher yeast inoculation
rate could reduce contaminant activities and, consequently,
the bioethanol production efﬁciency would be improved.

Global fossil fuels reserves decrease as energy require-
ments has been continuously grown. In the last two dec-
ades, the search for renewable, sustainable and
environmentally-friendly energy sources has been encour-
aged around the world in order to satisfy energy demands
and to prevent climate changes [ 1]. Bioethanol has been
recognized worldwide as an alternative to petroleum-
derived transport fuels and nowadays it represents more
than 90% of the global biofuel production [ 2–5]. For the
production of bioethanol, sugar (e.g. sugarcane or sugar
beet) and starch (e.g. corn or wheat) containing raw
materials as well as lignocellulosic raw materials can be
used [ 6,7]. Non-expensive and more abundant raw mate-
rials are desirable for industrial bioethanol production.
Lignocellulosic raw materials are considered as an attrac-
tive feedstock for the production of bioethanol because of
their availability in large quantities at relatively low cost,
thus reducing competition with food but not necessarily
with feed [ 7–13]. Microalgae and cyanobacteria are also
considered as a feedstock for bioethanol production [ 14].
Degradation of lignocellulosic raw materials is compli-
cated, energy-consuming and still an immature process
[7,15,16]. In the future, the use of modern genetics and
other tools will signiﬁcantly reduce the cost of producing
sugars from lignocellulosic raw materials [ 10,17]. Cur-
rently, the participation of raw materials in the ﬁnal bioe-
thanol price is in the range of 40–70% [ 18]. This
participation of raw materials in the bioethanol price can be
reduced by the use of waste products from forestry, agri-
culture and industry [ 10,19,20]. Furthermore, it is also
important that the bioethanol production will be located in
the renewable raw materials production region because of

portation and storage [ 21,22].
In Europe industrial production of bioethanol is still
based on the sugar and starch containing raw materials.Due to the often surplus of sugar beet as a raw material for
sugar production it is possible that sugar factories redirect
this sugar beet surplus into bioethanol production [ 23].
However, availability and transport of this raw material
represent major cost when new cost effective production
facilities are planned to be build up. Sugar production
plants with current equipment are capable to utilize dif-
ferent intermediates of sugar beet processing (e.g. rawsugar juice with 15–18% sugar or concentrated sugar syrup
with 65–67% sugar) as well as by-products (e.g. molasses
&50% sugar) for bioethanol production [ 24,25]. However,
production of these intermediates involves energy
demanding processes with main energy consuming opera-
tions like sugar extraction from sugar beet cossettes, sugarjuice concentration by evaporation, ethanol distillation as
well as distillers mash concentration and drying [ 26]. These
processes signiﬁcantly affect the energy input/output ratioand therefore they have direct impact on the ecological
sustainability of bioethanol production. The development
of integrated bioprocesses, in which simultaneous productsynthesis and in situ product removal are combined, can
result in more energy conserving and less expensive
bioethanol production. So far integrated bioprocess hasbeen successfully developed for acetone-butanol-ethanol
(ABE) fermentation [ 27]. Another possible aspect to con-
sider, as way of reducing production costs and increasingsustainability, is to replace liquid broth with semi-solid
substrate. So far different types of substrate and microor-
ganism in semi-solid bioethanol production were studied[28–32]. The promising idea for the reduction of bioethanol
production cost is the use of semi-solid intermediates of
sugar beet processing (e.g. cossettes or pulp) as a semi-solid substrate. Until now, investigation of bioethanol
production in semi-solid bioprocesses with ensilage sugar
beet pulp [ 33], mixed grape and sugar beet pomace [ 34]o r
mixed mash of sugar beet roots and potato tubers [ 21] were
performed. For efﬁcient and sustainable bioethanol pro-
duction different types of bioreactors have to be usedbecause of renewable feedstock’s diversity. Tubular
bioreactors are one possibility due to the fact that mixing is
more uniform in these bioreactors compared to the stirredtank bioreactors. Area-to-volume ratio is signiﬁcantly
higher in tubular bioreactors resulting in more efﬁcient
mass and heat transfer. This is important for bioprocesseswith semi-solid or solid substrates, photoreactions (maxi-
mum exposure to light) and shear sensitive organisms. Due
to the plug ﬂow conditions the gradients of concentrationsalong the bioreactor are formed that is advantageous in the
case of inhibition and/or repression kinetics. In these cases,high conversion efﬁciency and productivity can be simul-
taneously achieved. However, the major drawback of
tubular bioreactors is relatively low oxygen supply capac-
ity [ 35]. Currently, computational ﬂuid dynamic (CFD)
model is developing for description of simultaneous
extraction and fermentation process in the sugar beet cos-
settes [ 36].
In this research, the possibility of using untreated raw
sugar beet cossettes as a semi-solid substrate for bioethanol
production in the new developed type of horizontal rotating
tubular bioreactor (HRTB) was studied. Furthermore, the
optimal operational conditions of HRTB (i.e. the rotationspeed and the manner of bioreactor rotation as well as
bioreactor working volume) for semi-solid bioethanol
production were examined.
Materials and methods
Bioethanol production in a horizontal rotatingtubular bioreactor
In this research, bioethanol production from raw sugar beet
cossettes (as a semi-solid substrate) in the HRTB wasstudied. The HRTB is constructed as 0.6 m long and
0.25 m wide stainless steel tube with total volume of 30 L.
The interior of HRTB contains two paddles (0.04 m heightand 0.6 m length) ﬁxed on the bioreactor wall in order to
improve mixing and homogenization of bioreactor content.
The bioreactor was placed on the bearings that enablerotation of the whole bioreactor. Furthermore, bioreactor is
additionally equipped with a regulation system that enables
continuous or interval rotation with different rotation/stagnation times. In this research, yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (yeast strain isolated from sugar factory; Culture
collection of the Faculty of Food Technology andBiotechnology University of Zagreb; YSLZ-01) was used
as a microbial production strain. The inoculum for HRTB
inoculation was prepared in Erlenmeyer ﬂasks (ratiomedium/total volume =0.4) on the raw sugar beet juice
containing approximately 150 g L
-1of sugar with the
addition of 1 g L-1of NH 4H2PO4(as an additional source
of phosphate and nitrogen) in order to support yeast growth
and its physiological activity. The ﬂasks were cultivated on
a rotary shaker (rotation speed of 100 min-1) for 18 h at
28/C176C.
The study of bioethanol production in the HRTB was
also characterized by NH 4H2PO4addition (1 g kg-1of raw
sugar beet cossettes). Prior to the addition of raw sugar beet
cossettes and yeast inoculation, the bioreactor was steril-
ized at 121 /C176C (2 bars) for 20 min. In this study, bioethanol
production was examined by three different sets of HRTB
operational conditions. In the ﬁrst set of experimentsBioprocess Biosyst Eng
123bioethanol production was examined by continuous biore-
actor rotation during bioprocess where speed varied from 5
to 15 min-1. The second set of experiments was charac-
terized by using interval bioreactor rotation where biore-actor rotated minimum 3 and maximum 15 min per hour.
Bioreactor rotation speed was also varied in the range of
5–15 min
-1. In ﬁrst two sets of experiments, HRTB was
ﬁlled with 5 kg of unsterile raw sugar beet cossettes and
inoculated with 1 L of yeast suspension (16.67% v/w raw
sugar beet cossetets). In the third part of this research, the
effect of different working volume [ratio between the
working ( Vw) and total ( VT) bioreactor volume] of HRTB
on the bioethanol production was examined. In these
experiments, the mass of raw sugar beet cossettes in the
HRTB was changed in the range of 5–17.5 kg. The quan-tity of yeast suspension for these experiments was also
enlarged so that initial inoculation rate was 16.67% v/w of
raw sugar beet cossettes. The study of bioethanol produc-tion in the HRTB was performed at room temperature
without pH value correction. The bioethanol production in
the HRTB was monitored by sampling the liquid and thesolid part (sugar beet cossettes) of the broth. After that,
sugar beet cossettes were pressed by the hand juice press to
obtain liquid samples for analytical purposes. The durationof bioethanol production in the HRTB by all combinations
of operational parameters was determined by the ethanol
concentration that has to reach approximately constantlevel in the period of at least 48 h. All experiments in the
HRTB were at least repeated one time and the standard
deviation of all measurements was in the range of experi-mental error (below 4.8%).
Analytical methods and bioprocess efﬁciency
parameters
The yeast cell number (CFU mL
-1) in the liquid phase of
the broth was determined after cultivation on the diluted
sugar beet juice (approximately 30 g L-1sugars) medium
with 20 g L-1agar and 1.0 g L-1NH 4H2PO4in Petri
dishes at 28 /C176C for 48 h. During bioethanol production in
the HTRB dry mass of sugar beet cossettes was monitored
by gravimetrical method. Liquid samples of both sampletypes (liquid part of broth and liquid obtained by pressing
sugar beet cossettes) were centrifuged for 15 min at
4500 min
-1(3629 9g). Sediments obtained after centrifu-
gation of the liquid part of the broth were used for deter-
mination of dry biomass concentration by gravimetrical
method. The samples were dried at 105 /C176C until constant
mass was obtained. Supernatants were used for substrate
(glucose, fructose and sucrose) and metabolic products
(ethanol, glycerol, acetate and lactate) determination byhigh performance liquid chromatography with Supelco-
gel
TMC-610H column (Shimadzu CLASS-VP LC-10A VP,Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Mobile phase was phosphoric
acid solution (0.02 mol L-1) in demineralized water
(conductivity \1lSc m-1) and its ﬂow rate was
0.5 mL min-1. Before chromatographic analysis the pre-
pared supernatant solution was ﬁltered through a nylon
ﬁlter (0.22 lm) and subsequently degassed in ultrasonic
bath for 20 min. Bioprocess efﬁciency parameters weredetermined by standard procedures. For estimation of these
parameters data from liquid and solid part of broth were
used and average values of these parameters are presented
in Tables 1,2and3. Bioethanol yield was determined by
following equation:

Results and discussion
During this research bioethanol production from raw sugarbeet cossetets in the new type of HRTB was studied bydifferent bioreactor operational conditions. In our prelim-
inary research, the minimal inoculum quantity (16.67%
v/w raw sugar beet cossettes) that is required for successfulbioethanol production with yeast S. cerevisiae in the HRTB
was deﬁned. Further increase of inoculum quantity in the
HRTB was not related to the signiﬁcant increase of bioe-thanol production efﬁciency (data not shown). From
another point of view, the increase of inoculum quantity
was also related to the increase of free water content in theBioprocess Biosyst Eng
123broth, which consequently has an impact on the energy
demand for ethanol separation by distillation. Therefore, inthis research all experiments were performed by inocula-
tion rate of 16.67% v/w of raw sugar beet cossettes
that is related to the initial yeast concentration over10
7CFU mL-1in the liquid part of the broth. In order to
obtain an accurate view of bioethanol production under
these conditions, it was necessary to take samples from the
liquid as well as from the solid part (raw sugar beet cos-
settes) of the broth in the HRTB. In this research, someoscillations of monitored bioprocess parameters were
observed as a consequence of analytical errors and
heterogeneity of semi-solid substrate in the HRTB. Due tothe fact that non-sterile raw sugar beet cossettes were used
for bioethanol production, presence of acetate and lactatewas also detected in the broth as a consequence of the
activity of naturally present heterofermentative lactic acidbacteria (mostly Leuconostoc species especially Leu-
conostoc mesenteroides ) of the sugar beet [ 37]. During this
investigation HRTB rotation speed was changed in therange of 5–15 min
-1. At higher HRTB rotation speeds
([15 min-1; data not shown) acetic acid concentration was
considerably increased due to the higher activity of natu-
rally present heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria
(HFLAB) in these conditions. This phenomenon can beexplained as a consequence of HFLAB metabolism shift
from lactate and ethanol to the acetate production due to
the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity that is directly relatedto the oxygen supply in the broth [ 38–41]. Although lactate
concentration was monitored in the liquid as well as in theTable 1 Comparison of bioethanol production efﬁciency parameters by continuous HRTB rotation during bioprocess

123solid part of the broth during the entire research, its pres-
ence was detected only in negligible concentrations (below
0.15 g L-1). This effect additionally conﬁrmed the impact
of oxygen on the physiological activity of HFLAB. Fur-thermore, lactate as a non-fermentable substrate can be also
easily aerobically consumed by yeast cells [ 42]. Glucose,
fructose and sucrose concentrations were determined sep-arately, but in all ﬁgures and tables their values were
summarized and presented as a substrate concentration.
Total dry biomass in the liquid part of the broth in the
HRTB (Figs. 3,6) was also monitored, but due to the
presence of the debris of sugar beet cossettes in the liquidsamples, signiﬁcant oscillations of total dry biomass were
observed. Direct determination of biomass concentration
during semi-solid (or solid) bioprocesses is very difﬁcultdue to the impossibility of separating the microorganisms
from the substrate (especially by ﬁlamentous fungi).
Therefore, indirect methods for biomass determinationwere developed that include physical (e.g. scanning elec-
tron microscopy, epiﬂuorescence microscopy, ﬂow
cytometry, efﬂuent gas composition or light reﬂectance),chemical and biochemical [quantiﬁcation of cell-speciﬁc
components (e.g. ergosterol, glucosamine, chitin, nucleic
acids or proteins) or other cell parameters’ determination(e.g. intracellular water and total carbon content, enzymatic
or immunological activity or ATP levels, etc.) methods
[43–45]. However, all these methods have their own
advantages and disadvantages that have to be considered in
the selection procedure of method for biomass determina-
tion during semi-solid (or solid) bioprocesses. In our case,yeast cell number was determined by Thoma-chamber
counting and CFU determination. On the basis of obtained
results, it was observed that signiﬁcantly higher cellnumber oscillations were detected by Thoma-chamber
counting as compared to the CFU determination. There-
fore, it was decided that CFU determination will be used asan indicator of yeast growth although it has its own dis-
advantages (e.g. time consuming and accuracy level).
Furthermore, the accuracy of this method was additionallylowered due to the fact that in some samples the presence
of HFLAB was also observed (up to 10
5CFU mL-1; data
not shown) because of the use of non-sterile raw sugar beetcossettes.
Bioethanol production in the HRTB by continuous
bioreactor rotation
In the ﬁrst set of experiments, bioethanol production from
raw sugar beet cossettes in the HRTB was studied by
continuous bioreactor rotation (5–15 min
-1) during bio-
process. For example, experimental data obtained duringbioethanol production at continuous bioreactor rotation
speed of 5 min
-1are presented in Figs. 1,2and3.A si tcan be seen in Figs. 1and2, the difference between the
concentration of fermentable sugars in the liquid and solid
parts of the broth was insigniﬁcant, although a higher
concentration of sugars was detected in the sugar beetcossettes. Diffusion of sugars is the limiting process, but
once the sugar diffuses into the liquid part of the broth, it is
easily and very quickly used by the microorganisms pre-sent. Microorganisms present in the HRTB utilize carbon
source for their growth and products’ synthesis. Ethanol
and glycerol are detected as main yeast metabolism prod-ucts. However, metabolic products of naturally occurring
HFLAB on the sugar beet are acetic acid and lactic acid
[37,41]. At the beginning of the bioprocess, small amounts
of ethanol and glycerol were also detected as a conse-
quence of their entry in the HRTB by inoculation. In the
ﬁrst part of fermentation (till the 17th hour), the pH valueof the broth declined from 6.45 to 4.35 and remained
almost unchanged till the end of the bioprocess (Fig. 3). In
the ﬁrst 40 h, the increase of total biomass concentrationwas observed. After that period, it declined and stayed
almost unchanged due to accumulation of ethanol and
acetic acid and their inhibitory effect on the yeast cells.During the entire bioprocess, lactic acid was not detected.
On the basis of previous results, it is clear that naturally
occurring contaminants have inﬂuence on the bioprocessperformance efﬁciency [ 46]. Dry mass of sugar beet cos-
settes declined from 23.0 to 13.5% and it corresponds well
with the utilized total sugar concentration during thebioprocess (Fig. 2). The bioethanol yield was Y
P1=
39.84 g L-1. The conversion coefﬁcient was YP1=S=
0.27 g g-1which is 50.20% of the theoretical value. Bio-
process productivity achieved in this experiment was
Pr=0.247 g L-1h-1. Similar observations concerning
substrate utilization and products’ synthesis were observedby other two experiments conducted at higher bioreactor

123rotation speeds (10 and 15 min-1). As it can be seen in
Table 1, lower total bioethanol concentration and yield as
well as the bioprocess productivity was observed in these
experiments ( YP1=31.03 g L-1,YP1=S=0.19 g g-1,P r=

YP1=S=0.26 g g-1,P r=0.196 g L-1h-1at 15 min-1).
The increase of bioreactor rotation speed has signiﬁcant
impact on the bioprocess dynamics where higher rotations
were related to the better oxygen transfer rate and lessfavourable conditions for bioethanol production in the
HRTB [ 38–41].
Bioethanol production in the HRTB by interval
bioreactor rotation
On the basis of previous experimental results the new
experimental setup was established. In this experimentalsetup, the inﬂuence of interval HRTB rotation(3–15 min h
-1) and different HRTB rotation speeds
(5–15 min-1) on the bioethanol production was studied. At
the beginning of this research, it was shown that interval
rotation (3 min h-1at rotation speed of 5 min-1) has a
positive impact on bioethanol production. In these condi-
tions, bioprocess efﬁciency parameters were considerably
increased as compared to the previous experimental setup(Table 1). Bioethanol yield was Y
P1=60.78 g L-1,
YP1=S=0.36 g g-1, bioprocess efﬁciency E=66.90% and
productivity Pr =0.832 g L-1h-1, respectively (Table 2).
The positive impact on the bioprocess performance had
also relatively low acetic acid concentration (1.19 g L-1)
detected in these conditions. In further experiments,bioreactor rotation period in the rotation/stagnation ratio
was increased. At interval rotation of 6 min h
-1and rota-
tion of 5 min-1higher YP1=S=0.44 g g-1and
E=81.80%, but lower YP1=S=50.78 g L-1and
Pr=0.682 g L-1h-1were observed compared to the
experimental setup of 3 min h-1and 5 min-1. Bioethanol
production efﬁciency was also declined at interval rotation
of 9 min h-1and 5 min-1. Further increase of interval
rotation at 12 min h-1shows positive impact on the
bioethanol production, but lower bioprocess efﬁciency
parameters (except YP1=SandE) were observed compared
to the interval rotation of 3 min h-1at rotation speed of
5 min-1. However, at interval rotation of 15 min h-1
considerable reduction of bioprocess efﬁciency parameters
was detected as a consequence of intensive broth mixing
that is related to the increased oxygen supply. In theseconditions, HFLAB activity was increased and conse-
quently higher acetate concentration (7.43 g L
-1) was
detected what has negative impact on bioethanol produc-tion [ 38–41] (Table 2). In Table 2, products of yeast and
HFLAB metabolism are presented as conversion coefﬁ-
cients [ethanol ( Y
P1=S), glycerol ( YP2=S) and acetate ( YP3=S)].
Lactate conversion coefﬁcient is not presented due to the
negligible lactate concentrations (below 0.15 g L-1).
In further research, bioreactor rotation speed was
increased at 10 min-1by the same rotation/stagnation time
ratios (interval rotation). Bioethanol production at
3 min h-1and 10 min-1shows similar trends of biopro-
cess parameters changes as observed in previous experi-
mental setup (rotation speed of 5 min-1). Therefore,
similar values of bioethanol efﬁciency parameters werealso observed ( Y
P1=65.14 g L-1,YP1=S=0.40 g g-1,
E=74.30% and Pr =0.552 g L-1h-1). However, further
increase of interval rotation (rotation/stagnation time ratio)
did not result in improvement of bioethanol production.
This observation is conﬁrmed by the lower or similar levels
of bioethanol production efﬁciency. The exception is theexperiment at interval rotation of 9 min h
-1where bio-
process was ﬁnished in only 71 h and consequently higher

123bioprocess productivity was obtained (Pr =0.812 g L-1h-1).
In the next part of this investigation bioethanol produc-
tion was studied by the same interval rotations, but
increased HRTB rotation speed (15 min-1). First experi-
ment was done at interval rotation of 3 min h-1. The
bioprocess ended in only 60.5 h which resulted in the
highest bioprocess productivity (Pr =0,934 g L-1h-1)
recorded in all experiments performed in the HRTB. Other
bioprocess efﬁciency parameters were YP1=S=56.50
gL-1,YP1=S=0.35 g g-1and E=64.30%. Increase of
interval rotation at 6 min h-1resulted in higher acetic acid
concentrations what indicates that favorable conditions for
HFLAB activity were established. In this experiment, ﬁnalacetic acid concentration in the liquid part of broth was
7.52 g L
-1. Due to this phenomenon less substrate was
converted into ethanol and consequently reduction of bio-process efﬁciency was observed ( Y
P1=47.14 g L-1,
YP1=S=0.31 g g-1,E=57.6%, and Pr =0.327 g L-1h-1).
Slightly higher bioethanol concentration (52.10 g L-1) and
considerable reduction of bioprocess time (only 86 h)
resulted in higher values of bioprocess efﬁciency parame-
ters at interval rotation of 9 min h-1(15 min-1) compared
to the bioprocess conducted at interval rotation of
6 min h-1(15 min-1). Bioprocess productivity rose up to
0.606 g L-1h-1, but only slightly increase of
YP1=S=0.32 g g-1and E=58.70% was observed. In
these conditions, lower acetic acid concentration
(3.30 g L-1) was also detected. Bioethanol production at
interval rotation of 12 min h-1(15 min-1) lasted for 90 h,
but even lower acetic acid concentration was detected
(2.11 g L-1) compared to the bioethanol production at
6 min h-1(15 min-1). Therefore, bioethanol production
efﬁciency was enlarged ( YP1=55.64 g L-1,YP1=S=
0.47 g g-1,E=88.10% and Pr =0.618 g L-1h-1).
Changes of bioprocess parameters during this experimentare presented in Figs. 4,5and6.
As it can be seen in Figs. 4and5, higher total sugars
concentration was observed in the liquid (140 g L
-1)t h a ni n
the solid (122 g L-1) part of broth. This observation shows
that mixing conditions (rotation speed and duration of interval
rotation) and physiological characteristics of sugar beet cos-settes (closely related to the sugar beet storage conditions)
have signiﬁcant impact on sugars release from the sugar beet
cossettes [ 33]. Changes of bioethanol, glycerol and acetate
concentrations are in agreement with substrate consumption.
Concentrations of all three fermentation products were on the
similar levels in the liquid and solid part of broth. Changes inthe dry mass of cossettes (Fig. 5) correspond well with
changes in substrate concentration, which indicate that
released sugars (glucose, fructose and sucrose) were imme-diately used in the fermentation process. In ﬁrst 20 h of bio-
process, pH value of liquid part of broth (Fig. 6) was reducedfrom 6.01 to 4.59 due to the acetic acid synthesis by HFLAB.
As it can be seen in Fig. 6, increase of dry biomass was reg-
istered in the ﬁrst 20 h of bioprocess and after that consider-able oscillations of this parameter were observed. As
mentioned earlier, this phenomenon is a consequence of the
presence of cossettes debris in samples as well as the hetero-geneity of cultivation broth. However, yeast cell number (log
N) shows more stable trend during the bioprocess which
indicates that it could be used as an indicator of yeast growth.It has to be pointed out that HFLAB was also detected during
microbiological analysis (up to 10
5CFU mL-1), which
reduces reliability and accuracy of this determination. Bioe-thanol production was also studied at interval rotation of
15 min h
-1(15 min-1). In these conditions, increased con-
centrations of glycerol (13.85 g L-1) and acetic acid

123(6.74 g L-1) were observed as a consequence of intensive
broth mixing. In enlarged oxygen supply and substrate con-centration conditions, higher glycerol and acetate synthesis
rates were present and therefore higher concentrations of both
products were detected [ 38–41,47–49]. On the basis of results
present in Table 2, it can be concluded that the optimal con-
ditions for bioethanol production on the raw sugar beet cos-
settes in the HRTB are interval rotation of 12 min h
-1and
rotation speed of 15 min-1. This statement is based on
the fact that the highest substrate conversion into ethanol
(YP1=S=0.47 g g-1) and bioprocess efﬁciency ( E=
87.36%) were obtained with relatively low acetate
(2.11 g L-1) and glycerol (8.21 g L-1) concentration.
Because of the fact that the economic feasibility of bioethanolproduction is based on the carbon source accessibility and
price [ 19,22] these operational parameters of HRTB were
selected as optimal for bioethanol production. Furthermore,other two bioprocess efﬁciency parameters ( Y
P1and Pr) were
also at acceptable levels for successful conduction of bioe-thanol production. Obtained bioprocess efﬁciency parametersare also in the range with bioethanol production from the raw
sugar beet juice [ 24].
Bioethanol production in the HRTB by different
V
W/VTratio
In the last part of this research, the impact of ratio between
working ( VW) and total ( VT) volume of HRTB on the
bioethanol production was studied. However, it should bepointed out that oscillations in analytical results were
observed due to the non-homogenous substrate in the
HRTB. Furthermore, it was expected that the reduction ofthe HRTB free space would be related to reduced oxygen
supply possibility for natural contaminants of raw sugar
beet cossettes what could additionally support bioethanolproduction by yeast. In this investigation, bioethanol pro-
duction was performed in the HRTB by using 5–17.5 kg of
raw sugar beet cossettes (0.2–0.7 V
W/VT) by interval
rotation of 12 min h-1and rotation speed of 15 min-1.I n
all experiments yeast inoculation rate was 16.67% v/w of
raw sugar beet cossettes. On the basis of obtained results it
can be generally pointed out that increase of HRTBworking volume was related to the reduction of bioethanol
production efﬁciency (Table 3).
In experiment with 0.4 V
W/VTslightly lower bioethanol
production efﬁciency was observed compared to the experi-
ment with 0.2 VW/VT. In this experiment, bioprocess efﬁciency
parameters have following values: YP1=48.97 g L-1,
YP1=S=0.45 g g-1,E=83.64% and Pr =0.560 g L-1h-1.
In experiment with 0.5 VW/VTraw sugar beet cossettes con-
tained increased concentratio no fH F L A Ba n dt h e r e f o r ea c e t i c
acid concentration raised up very quickly (ﬁrst 22 h) at
4.43 g L-1and consequently pH value was lowered at 3.78. In
these conditions, yeast activity was considerably slowed down
and therefore bioethanol production efﬁciency was reduced
(Table 3). This observation is the most obvious by the pro-
longation of bioprocess time that affects bioprocess produc-
tivity (Pr =0.312 g L-1h-1). In this experiment relatively
high glycerol concentration (10.62 g L-1) was also observed
as a consequence of nonadequate bioethanol production con-
ditions [ 47–49]. In experiment with 0.6 VW/VTlower acetic
acid concentration was detected (3.31 g L-1) and therefore
bioethanol production efﬁciency parameters were increased:
YP1=48.8 g L-1,YP1=S=0 . 3 7gg-1,E=68.77% and
Pr=0.548 g L-1h-1. This observation shows that HFLAB
were present at lower concentr ation compared to the previous
experiment, but these conditions were also not favorable for
bioethanol production. In experiment with 0.7 VW/VTacetic
acid concentration was not considerably increased duringbioprocess although its ﬁnal concentration was 3.65 g L
-1.
Therefore, bioprocess efﬁcien cy parameters have following
values: YP1=53.85 g L-1,YP1=S=0.37 g g-1,E=
68.77% and Pr =0.552 g L-1h-1. On the basis of results
presented in Table 3it is obvious that studied combinations of
HRTB operational parameters could create conditions forefﬁcient bioethanol production at V
W/VTratio up to 0.4.
However, it is also important to point out that further opti-
mization of HRTB operational parameters have to be per-formed in order to increase the efﬁciency of bioethanol
production at V
W/VTratio higher than 0.5.
Conclusions
On the basis of these results it is clear that that bioreactor
operational conditions (rotation speed, type of rotation and
VW/VTratio) have signiﬁcant impact on the efﬁciency of

operational conditions has to be performed at VW/VTratio
higher than 0.5 in order to obtain higher bioethanol pro-
duction efﬁciency. Naturally present microorganisms(mostly HFLAB) of sugar beet could have signiﬁcant
impact on the bioethanol production in the HRTB. Higher
yeast inoculation rate could reduce the HFLAB activity andconsequently the bioethanol production efﬁciency will be
improved.
