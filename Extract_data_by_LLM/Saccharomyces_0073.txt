Abstract Several fungal endophytes of the Egyp-
tian marine sponge Latrunculia corticata were
isolated, including strains Trichoderma sp. Merv6,
Penicillium sp. Merv2 and Aspergillus sp. Merv70.
These fungi exhibited high cellulase activity using
different lignocellulosic substrates in solid state
fermentations (SSF). By applying mutagenesis and
intergeneric protoplast fusion, we have obtained a
recombinant strain (Tahrir-25) that overproducedcellulases (exo- b-1,4-glucanase, endo- b-1,4-glucan-
ase and b-1,4-glucosidase) that facilitated complete
cellulolysis of agricultural residues. The processparameters for cellulase production by strain Tahrir-
25 were optimized in SSF. The highest cellulase
recovery from fermentation slurries was achievedwith 0.2% Tween 80 as leaching agent. Enzyme
production was optimized under the following con-
ditions: initial moisture content of 60% (v/w),inoculum size of 10
6spores ml-1, average substrate
particle size of 1.0 mm, mixture of sugarcane bagasse
and corncob (2:1) as the carbon source supplementedwith carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and corn steep
solids, fermentation time of 7 days, medium pH of
5.5 at 30 /C176C. These optimized conditions yielded 450,
191, and 225 units/gram dry substrate (U gds-1)o f
carboxylmethyl cellulase, ﬁlter-paperase (FPase), and
b-glucosidase, respectively. Subsequent fermentation
by the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae NRC2, using
lignocellulose hydrolysates obtained from the opti-
mized cellulase process produced the highest amountof ethanol (58 g l
-1). This study has revealed the
potential of exploiting marine fungi for cost-effective
production of cellulases for second generation bio-ethanol processes.

Introduction
Cellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable
natural product in the biosphere. It can be biocon-
verted into fermentable sugar by a complex of
enzyme (exo- b-1,4-glucanase, endo- b-1,4-glucanase,
andb-1,4-glucosidase) that act synergistically in
hydrolysis of the b-1,4-glycosidic bonds. This makes
cellulosic biomass an enticing feedstock for alcoholicfermentations. However, the production of hydro-
lases required to degrade lignocellulosic substratesA. M. A. El-Bondkly

DOI 10.1007/s10482-011-9639-1currently constitute approximately 40% of the total
cost of ethanol production. Therefore, there has been
an extensive effort to isolate microorganisms with ahigh ability to produce hydrolytic enzymes from
inexpensive and readily available lignocellulosic
residues (Camassola and Dillon 2007 ; Girio et al.
2010 ). Components of cellulase system were classi-
ﬁed based on their structural properties. Cellulases
are one of the largest groups in structural classiﬁca-tion of glycosyl hydrolases. Cellulases and hemicel-
lulases make up 15 of 20 identiﬁed glycosyl
hydrolases families and some families are stilldivided to subfamilies (Mathew et al. 2008 ).
Egypt has abundant biomass residues from wheat,
rice, corn, and sugarcane (El-Bondkly 2006 ;
El-Gendy 2010 ). The use of sugarcane bagasse as a
cellulosic ethanol feedstock provides a solution for
the removal of this waste product while increasingthe economic yield of the process (Camassola and
Dillon 2007 ). Whereas a large number of fungi can
convert plant materials to fermentable sugars byenzymatic hydrolysis, only a few of them produce
signiﬁcant quantities of cell-free hydrolases capable
of efﬁciently hydrolyzing complex lignocelluloses.This has made the production of cost-effective
cellulases with high homogeneity from wild-type
strains of fungi a challenge (Bailey and Nevalainen1981 ; Lee et al. 2011 ).
Cellulase genes and their control systems can vary
in different species or genera of related microorgan-isms that secrete cellulases. They could be recom-
bined through protoplast fusion and powerful
screening techniques could then be used to choosethe better recombinant strains (Zhang et al. 2006 ).
Protoplast fusion is also a very powerful approach for
rapid genetic improvement when associated withmutation techniques. This has involved gene transfer
between different Trichoderma species and Aspergil-
lus niger through intergeneric protoplast fusion to
convert ground rice straw to citric acid. Similar
techniques have been used for cellulase (El-Bondkly
2006 ), successive construction of b-glucosidase
hyperproducers of Trichoderma harzianum using
microbial biotechnology techniques (El-Bondklyet al. 2010 ), keratinases from a new recombinant
fusant of marine Micromonospora (El-Bondkly and
El-Gendy 2010 ), as well as genome shufﬂing of the
marine-derived bacterium, Nocardia sp. ALAA 2000for improved ayamycin production (El-Gendy and
El-Bondkly 2011 ).
Genetic recombination was accomplished by bring-
ing together the genomes of different mutants from the
different genera of endophytic strains ( Trichoderma
sp. Merv6 9Penicillium sp. Merv2 9Aspergillus sp.
Merv70). It was carried out through protoplast fusion
resulting in overproduction of cost-effective cellulosic
enzymes which could address the problem of ethanolproduction from different cellulosic wastes. The
recombinants were investigated for production of
carboxylmethyl cellulase, ﬁlter-paperase (FPase), andb-glucosidase activities in solid-state fermentations,
followed by evaluation of the impact of these
pretreatments on ethanol production by yeast. Cellu-lases process parameters by the hyperproducer fusant
were then optimized. To the best of our knowledge
there has been no report on the production of suchcellulolytic enzymes from genetically constructed
marine endophytic fungi for the enhancement of
hydrolytic activity toward plant waste materials, aswell as for the production of high titers of a complete
cellulase complex from a single organism.
Materials and methods
Collection of raw materials
In this study, residue samples of rice straw, wheat
straw, corn straw, and corncob were collected from
ﬁelds of the Kafr El-Sheikh governorate, whereas
sugarcane bagasse was obtained from a local sugarfactory. The samples were sun dried followed by
overnight oven drying at 60 /C176C, ground into powder
form and kept at 4 /C176C for further use as sole carbon
source.
Sponge material collection and processingHealthy specimens of the Egyptian sponge Latruncu-
lia corticata were collected from Sharm El-Sheikh of
the Red Sea, Egypt in plastic bags containing
seawater, which were immediately transported inice bags for processing as described by El-Gendy
(2010 ). Taxonomic identiﬁcation of the sponge was
performed by the National Institute of Oceanographyand Fisheries Research Station, Hurghada, Egypt.332 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2012) 101:331–346
123Isolation of marine-derived endophytic fungi
The sponge specimen was placed on a sterile cutting
surface, sterilized as described before (El-Gendy
2010 ) and cut along the cross-section multiple times
to create sections 3–5 mm in width that were washed
three times in sterilized seawater with a sterile scalpel
blade. Each section (about 20 pieces per medium)was placed into the centre of a Petri dish containing
one of the different types of media used. Eight
different media were used for isolation of fungi. Theywere glucose yeast extract-peptone agar (GYPA),
potato dextrose agar (PDA), marine agar (MA), malt
extract agar (MEA), Czapek’s dextrose agar (CDA),corn meal agar (CMA), Sabouraud dextrose agar
(SDA), and carboxymethyl cellulose agar (CMCA)
supplemented with 0.3% urea prepared in seawater.Each medium was supplemented with penicillin and
streptomycin (40,000 units and 0.1 g in 100 ml
medium, respectively) to inhibit bacterial growth.The plates were incubated at 30 /C176C in the dark and
inspected daily for 4 weeks. Each distinct colony
morphotype appearing around the sponge sections onisolation plates was picked and obtained in pure
culture (using the medium on which colonies were
initially isolated). Phenotypic and chemotaxonomiccharacterizations of endophytic fungal isolates were
performed following the protocol of (Rifai 1969 ;
Kohlmeyer and Kohlmeyer 1979 ; Samson 1979 ;
Samson and Gams 1984 ; Bissett 1991a ,b; Blomquist
et al. 1992 ) and (Stahl and Klug 1996 ).
Maintenance of cellulolytic strains and inoculum
preparation
All cellulolytic endophytic fungal isolates were
grown and maintained on Sabouraud dextrose agar
(SDA) for 7 days at 30 /C176C until conidia formation.
The spores were harvested with sterile seawater
containing 0.1% Tween 80 and used to inoculate the
solid-state fermentation (SSF) after adjusting thedesired spore count (10
6spore ml-1).
Induction of mutationFor UV-mutagenesis, spores obtained from 7-day-old
slants of each parental strain ( Trichoderma sp.
Merv6, Penicillium sp. Merv2, and Aspergillus sp.
Merv70) were resuspended in 0.85% NaCl andirradiated with UV light (254 nm) from a Philips
TUV-30 W lamp source at a distance of 25 cm for 5
and 15 min (the amount of time necessary to kill85–95% of the cells). The treated conidia were put in
the dark for one h and transferred to dishes of SDA
medium containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Theisolated mutants were screened for cellulase activities
by the agar diffusion test on CMCA medium and
incubated for 4 days at 30 /C176C. Triplicate sets of plates
were prepared for each mutant. After incubation, the
plates were stained with 0.1% Congo red dye
(20 min), followed by destaining with 1 M NaClsolution for 20 min.
For the isolation of antifungal-resistant and hyper-
cellulytic mutants; the hypertonic regeneration med-ium (the same as the protoplast medium with the
addition of 10.0 g/l CMC as carbon source instead of
glucose) and ﬁve antifungal agents were used. Theconcentrations of the antifungal agents added were as
follows: 5 lg/ml benomyl, 5 lg/ml miconazole,
150lg/ml cycloheximide, and 25 lg/ml 5-ﬂuoroura-
cil. Colonies that exhibited resistance or sensitivity to
a speciﬁc antifungal were retested on the same
antifungal dose to be sure of their resistance orsensitivity stability and used as markers to select the
fusants.
Protoplast formation and fusion
For protoplast fusion, we used the hyperactive
cellulolytic mutant strains TM 21, PM 45, and AM
64, which were obtained from the wild type of
Trichoderma sp. Merv6, Penicillium sp. Merv2, and
Aspergillus sp. Merv70, respectively, after UV radi-
ation. Protoplasts were prepared through enzymatic
hydrolysis of mycelial suspensions using the proce-dure of El-Bondkly 2006 . Cultures were grown in
liquid protoplast medium composed of (g/l distilled
water): glucose, 80.0; NH
4NO 3, 2.0; KH 2PO4, 10.0;
MgSO 4/C17H2O, 0.25; FeCl 3/C16H2O, 0.02; MnSO 4, 0.14
with an initial pH 5.0. Fifty milliliter of medium was
dispensed into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer ﬂask for the
development of mycelia. The ﬂasks were incubated at
30/C176C overnight on a shaker maintained at 160 rpm
(El-Bondkly 2006 ). After incubation, the mycelium
were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with
0.7 M KCl in 25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 5.8, andresuspended in phosphate buffer (50 mg/ml) contain-
ing 0.7 M KCl and 10 mg/ml Novozyme 234. TheAntonie van Leeuwenhoek (2012) 101:331–346 333
123lytic mixtures were incubated at 30 /C176C with gentle
shaking for 3 h. Incubation mixtures were ﬁltered,
and protoplasts were counted in the ﬁltered lysate.Protoplasts prepared from each of the three mutants
were mixed and suspended in 30% (w/v) polyethyl-
ene glycol 6,000 solution containing 0.05 M glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 7.5, and 0.05 M CaCl
2. After
incubation at 30 /C176C for 10 min, the suspension was
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Treated protoplastpellets were resuspended in 1 ml of osmatically
balanced phosphate buffer, diluted appropriately, and
plated on the hypertonic selective and nonselectiveregeneration media. The hypertonic, selective, and
regeneration medium is the same as the protoplast
medium with the addition of 10.0 g/l CMC as carbonsource instead of glucose, 0.7 M KCl, 0.1% (v/v)
Triton X-100, 20.0 g/l agar, and the antifungal agents
as selectable markers. Plates were incubated at 30 /C176C
until colonies grew on the surface of plates. The
grown colonies were considered as complementary
fusants. They were transplanted and subculturedseveral times onto selective and nonselective media
before further studies. Fusion frequency was
expressed as the ratio of the number of coloniesformed on selective and nonselective media. The
cellulase activities of the selected parental strains,
mutants, and fusants were determined on the differenttype of agricultural residues (sugarcane bagasse, rice
straw, wheat straw, corn straw, and corncob).
Production of cellulases under solid state
and submerged fermentation
For SSF, the fungi were cultured in Erlenmeyer ﬂasks
(250 ml) containing 10 g of each agricultural residue
separately as a substrate moistened with 10 ml ofmineral salts solution. The composition of the mineral
salts solution was (g l
-1): KCl, 0.5; MgSO 4/C17H2O, 0.5;
NaNO 3, 3.0; NaH 2PO4, 0.5; 0.01; FeSO 4/C17H2O, and
pH 5.0. The ﬂasks were inoculated with 106spores
ml-1obtained from 7-day-old cultures. Flasks were
incubated at 30 /C176C under static conditions for 7 days. In
submerged fermentation (SMF), the composition of
the mineral salts medium was the same as that of theSSF but 50 ml were transferred into a 250 ml Erlen-
meyer ﬂask supplemented with 2% lignocellulosic
substrate with an initial pH of 5.0 and inoculated with10
6spore ml-1. The cultures were incubated on a
rotary shaker (200 rpm) at 30 /C176C for 7 days.Optimization of cellulase parameters under SSF
The cellulase production parameters were optimized
under SSF and the parameters optimized earlier were
incorporated in subsequent experiments. The param-eters optimized included, typical time course of
cellulase production (1–14 days), enzyme recovery
with various extractants such as Tween 80 (0.1, 0.2,and 0.3%), NaCl (1.0%), citrate buffer (pH 5.0,
0.2 M), phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 0.2 M), glycine-
NaOH buffer (pH 10.0) on a rotary shaker at 150 rpmfor 120 min, initial moisture level (20, 40, 50, 60, 70,
and 80%), particle size (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, and
3.0 mm), spore concentration (1 910
3,19104,
19105,19106,19107, and 1 9108spores
ml-1), supplementation of fermentation medium with
different ratios of bagasse and corncob (1:1, 2:1,1:2,1:3, and 3:1), nutrients (carbon source supplementa-
tion by glucose, sucrose, lactose, avicel, or carboxy-
methyl cellulose; and nitrogen source supplementationby yeast extract, peptone, or corn steep), initial pH
values (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and incubation temper-
atures (25, 30, 35, and 40 /C176C).
Enzyme assay
Samples were collected every 24 h during fermenta-
tion for the determination of cellulase activities. The
activities of FPase and CMCase were investigated bymeasuring the production of reducing sugar by the
dinitrosalicylic acid reducing sugar using the method
recommended by Ghose ( 1987 ).b-Glucosidase activ-
ity was routinely assayed with p-nitrophenyl- b-
D-
glucopyranoside as the substrate by using the method
of Saha and Bothast ( 1996 ). One international unit of
FPAase, CMCase, or b-glucosidase was deﬁned as the
amount of enzymes that released 1 lmol of glucose
(reducing sugar) or p-nitrophenol per min during the
hydrolysis reaction. Enzyme activities were calcu-
lated for 1 g of substrate dry matter (SDM). All values
given are the average of triplicates.
Effect of pH and temperature on enzyme activity
and stability
The dependency on temperature of enzyme activity
was determined under standard conditions maintaininga constant pH at a varying temperature. For the heat
stability measurement, the enzyme was incubated for334 Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2012) 101:331–346
12360 min at a temperature from 25 to 65 /C176C, followed by
the determination of the residual cellulolytic activity.
The optimum pH for cellulolytic activity was
investigated by measuring the enzyme activity in
various buffers between pH 4.0 and 10.0 (using
0.05 M citrate buffer for pH 4.0–5.0, 0.05 M phos-phate buffer for pH 7.0–8.0, 0.2 M Tris-HCl buffer
for pH 9.0, and 0.05 M glycine-NaOH buffer for pH
10.0). Stability to pH was assessed by assaying theresidual activity (%) after incubating the enzyme at
room temperature for 24 h at given pH values ranging
from 4.0 to 10.0.
Alcoholic fermentation
After 7 days of the sacchariﬁcation step, fermentation
followed using a 10% volume of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae NRC2 in YM medium (3 g l
-1yeast extract,
3gl-1malt extract, 5 g l-1peptone, 10 g l-1glucose)
for 6–10 days. After fermentation, the broth was ﬁltered
and the amount of alcohol formed was determined bythe spectrophotometric method (Caputi et al. 1968 ).
Results and discussion
Isolation and identiﬁcation of endophytic marine-
derived fungal strains
107 fungal isolates representing nine genera were
isolated from the inner healthy tissue of Egyptian
marine sponge Latrunculia corticata ; 17, 13, 18, 9,
11, 6, 9, and 24 isolates were isolated on thefollowing media: malt extract agar (MEA), glucoseyeast extract peptone agar (GYPA), potato dextrose
agar (PDA), marine agar (MA), carboxymethylcellu-
lose agar supplemented with 0.3% urea (CMCA),Czapek’s dextrose agar (CDA), corn meal agar
(CMA), and Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA), respec-
tively. Of these isolates; 23.5, 15.4, 33.3, 11.1, 100, 0,11.1, and 41.7% were cellulolytic fermentation fungi.
Whereas, SDA medium appeared to be the best
medium for maximum recovery of fungi among thevarious media used, CMCA medium was the best for
isolation of cellulolytic fungi (Table 1). The endo-
phytic strains, according to their combined morpho-logical and biochemical approaches, belonged to nine
fungal genera Acremonium, Phanerochaete, Drechs-
lera,Pestalotiopsis, Fusarium ,Penicillium ,Tricho-
derma, Rhinocladiella , and Aspergillus according to
the protocols of Rifai ( 1969 ), Kohlmeyer and Kohl-
meyer ( 1979 ), Samson ( 1979 ), Samson and Gams
(1984 ), Bissett ( 1991a ,b), Blomquist et al. ( 1992 ),
and Stahl and Klug ( 1996 ). Previous studies had
shown that there is a wide variety of differentmicroorganisms such as bacteria and fungi associated
with sponges or corals (Holler et al. 2000 ; El-Gendy
2010 ; El-Bondkly and El-Gendy 2010 ).
Among all endophytic marine fungal isolates,
strains under the isolation numbers Merv6, Merv2,
and Merv70 showed the highest cellulolytic activityagainst a wide range of agriculture wastes. According
to the protocols mentioned before for the traditional
morphological phenotypic and other chemotypicfeatures, Merv6, 2, and 70 belonged to those of
Trichoderma ,Penicillium, and Aspergillus species,
respectively. These hyperactive cellulolytic strainswere selected and subjected to mutation and

123intergeneric protoplast fusion to obtain new recom-
binants. The goal was to achieve potential hydrolytic
activity toward different lignocellulosic residues ofhard structures yielding the highest level of reducing
sugars, which could be converted into ethanol by
S. cerevisiae NRC2 .
Ultraviolet light (UV) mutagenicity, cellulase
productivity, and response to antifungal agents
UV irradiation was carried out at two different
exposure times, 5 and 15 min at a distance of 25 cmto kill 85–95% of the spores to induce mutations in
each of Trichoderma sp. Merv6, Penicillium sp.
Merv2, and Aspergillus sp. Merv70. Data (not shown)
indicated that 80 various types of mutants were
isolated from each strain after UV irradiation. The
most efﬁcient mutagenesis in each original strain wasconsidered to occur when a mutagen confers a high
frequency of mutations in the range of 85–95%
lethality. The isolated mutants were screened forcellulase activities by the agar diffusion test on
CMCA medium, and the hypercellulolytic mutants
were selected for further study.
The parental strains and 15 hypercellulolytic
mutants were studied for their resistance or sensitivity
to the antifungal agents benomyl, miconazole, cyclo-heximide, and 5-ﬂuorouracil (data not shown). After
application of different UV-light doses, the hypercel-
lulolytic mutants showed different responses to anti-fungal agent concentrations. Three mutants, i.e.,
TM21, PM45, and AM64, isolated from Trichoderma
sp. Merv6, Penicillium sp. Merv2, and Aspergillus sp.
Merv70 were resistant to benomyl, miconazole,
cycloheximide, and 5-ﬂuorouracil. Although Tricho-
derma sp. Merv6 was sensitive to benomyl, miconaz-
ole, and cycloheximide, it showed resistance to 25 lg/
ml of 5-ﬂuorouracil. On the other hand, its mutant
(TM21) was sensitive to miconazole, and cyclohexi-mide, and resistant to benomyl, and 5-ﬂuorouracil.
Penicillium sp. Merv2 and its mutant PM45 were
resistant to miconazole, and cycloheximide at 5 and
150lg/ml concentrations, respectively. Moreover,
they were sensitive to 5 lg/ml of benomyl and
25lg/ml of 5-ﬂuorouracil Aspergillus sp. Merv70
was sensitive to benomyl and miconazole, and resis-
tant to cycloheximide and 5-ﬂuorouracil but its mutantAM64 was resistant to miconazole and 5-ﬂuorouracil,
as well as sensitive to benomyl and cycloheximide.Gene transfer through intergeneric protoplast
fusion
Gradual degradation of fungal mycelia started after the
addition of 10 mg/ml of the Novozyme 234 enzyme.Digestion of the whole cell wall was achieved follow-
ing incubation at 30 /C176C with gentle shaking for 3 h.
Maximum release of protoplasts was obtained withmutant TM21 which yielded 3.2 910
6protoplasts per
ml. From the mycelium of mutant PM45, the highest
yield of protoplasts, i.e., 2.0 9106was obtained after a
three h incubation period. On the other hand,
1.89106/ml of protoplasts were released from the
mycelium of AM64 after 3 h incubation time.
Insertion of genes from different genera into one
cell by intergeneric protoplast fusion is an efﬁcient
tool to improve the productivity and properties ofsome important industrial microorganisms (El-Bond-
kly2006 ). This study aimed to combine cellulase
genes from three fungi into a recombinant fusanthaving the ability to produce more cellulases with
new properties. Based on the results of either
resistance or sensitivity to one or more of the fourantifungal agents used in this study, the intergeneric
protoplast fusion experiment involved three different
mutants. These were TM21, PM45, and AM64,isolated from the three different genera of Tricho-
derma sp. Merv6, Penicillium sp. Merv2, and Asper-
gillus sp. Merv70, respectively, after UV-exposure.
Equal amounts of protoplasts, prepared from young
mycelia of each of the three mutants, were fused.
Fusion frequency, which is the ratio of the number ofcolonies regenerating on the nonselective medium to
the number of colonies formed on the selective
medium, was found to be 1.4 910
-3. Fused protop-
lasts were spread on the selective medium containing
antifungal agents along with CMC as the sole carbon
source. After the incubation period, only 11 coloniesappeared after ﬁve intergeneric protoplast fusion
experiments between the three genera. They were
transferred onto slants and repeatedly subcultured formany generations on the selective medium to be
tested for both true recombination and stability.

123under study to different degrees of hydrolysis.
Cellulases were produced irrespective of the sub-
strates and there was a distinct difference between theparental fungi, their mutants and recombinants in
ability to produce the cellulases on effective, inex-
pensive and readily available lignocellulose sub-strates in solid-state cultivations. Whereas cellulases
from Trichoderma sp. Merv6 (P1) showed high
endoglucanase and exoglucanase activities withlower b-glucosidase levels, cellulases from Penicil-
lium sp. Merv2 (P2) had promising b-glucosidase
activity but moderate endoglucanase and exoglucan-ase activities. On the other hand, Aspergillus sp.
Merv70 (P3) showed the highest b-glucosidase
activity with low endoglucanase or exoglucanaseactivities, hence limited efﬁciency in cellulose hydro-
lysis. However, the screening of recombinant fusants
from intergeneric protoplast fusion between selectedparental mutants (TM21, PM45, and AM64) refers to
recombinant fusants such as Tahrir-4, Tahrir-8, and
Tahrir-9 showed cellulase pattern of mutant TM21.Some fusants had the cellulase pattern of mutant
PM45 (Tahrir-2, Tahrir-6, and Tahrir-10) but only
one fusant (Tahrir-3) had the cellulase pattern ofmutant AM64. The others had new patterns different
from their parental strains, Tahrir-1, Tahrir-5, Tahrir-
7, and Tahrir-25. Among these recombinant fusants,Tahrir-25 showed the best activity. It produced
CMCase, FPase, and b-glucosidase at yields of
196.1, 79.1, and 95.5 U gds
-1as compared to the
parental strains; Trichoderma sp. Merv6 (P1, 60.5,
28.0, 10.5 U gds-1),Penicillium sp. Merv2 (P2, 25.0,
11.2, and 15.8 U gds-1),Aspergillus sp Merv70 (P3,
12.2, 3.5, and 25.0 U gds-1), their mutants (TM21,
PM45, and AM64) or other recombinants (Table 2).
Thus, Tahrir-25 was selected for further enzymaticstudies on complete cellulose hydrolysis of agricul-
tural residues.
Sugarcane bagasse was the best inducer for
exoglucanase, endoglucanase, and b-glucosidase pro-
duction. The suitable cellulolytic hydrolytic charac-
teristics of the cellulase complex in the Tahrir-25
fusant are possibly due to the high b-glucosidase
activities generated by protoplast fusion. Therefore,genetic construction of fungal strains can be an
effective tool in bio-subsequent ethanol production
from agricultural byproducts by increasing the for-mation of reducing sugars and proteins of plant waste
materials. Incorporation of cheap sugarcane bagasseinto media for the production of lignocellulose
enzymes by fungi in SSF should contribute to a
decrease in the costs of the production of enzymaticcomplexes. Thus, would contribute greatly to the
economic production of bioethanol (Gutierrez-Correa
and Tengerdy 1997 ; Camassola and Dillon 2007 ).
Efﬁciency of intergeneric protoplast fusion
technique on crude cellulase activities
Data in Tables 3and 4showed that intergeneric
protoplast fusion is a promising tool for overproduc-tion of cellulolytic enzymes with improved properties
by the recombinant fusant Tahrir-25. For parental and
recombinant strains, the optimum pH for cellulasesactivity ranged from 5.0 to 6.0. Activities of CMCase,
FPase, and b-glucosidase from Trichoderma sp.
Merv6 (P1) were higher (60.6, 28.0, and11.0 U gds
-1) in more acidic (pH 5.0) and higher
temperature (50 /C176C) conditions. CMCase, FPase, and
b-glucosidase from Penicillium sp. Merv2 showed
maximum activities (25.8, 11.2, and 16.2 U gds-1)a t
pH 5.5–6.0 and 40–45 /C176C.Aspergillus sp. (P3)
displayed its optimum b-glucosidase activity at pH
5 and 40–50 /C176C. However, the enzymes of the
recombinant fusants exhibited potent CMCase and
FPase activities at low temperature (40 /C176C) and pH
5.5. Moreover, b-glucosidase exhibited potent activ-
ity (96.3 U gds-1) at pH 5.0 cellulases (CMCase;
FPase, and b-glucosidase, of the recombinant strain
were more stable up to 65 /C176C with pH up to 8.0 as
compared to its parental strains (P1, P2, and P3).
Temperature and pH characteristics proﬁle of Tahrir-25 cellulase enzymes make it very useful for
industrial application. These results conﬁrm that
recombinant DNA technology is useful to increaseproduction levels of enzymes and to improve the
stability, activity, and speciﬁcity of industrial
enzymes (Cowan 1996 ; El-Bondkly and El-Gendy
2010 ).

Trichoderma sp. Merv6, Penicillium sp. Merv2,
Aspergillus sp. Merv70, and their recombinant fusant
Tahrir-25, respectively (Table 5). This probably was
due to the biosynthesis of cellulases in the SMF
process being strongly affected by catabolic and by theend-product repression. A recent report describes the
overcoming of these repressions to a signiﬁcant extent
by the SSF system (El-Gendy 2010 ). Cellulase yields
of 250–430 U/g were recorded in SSF of wheat straw
representing an increase of 72% as compared to the
yields 160–250 U/g of cellulase in liquid-state fer-mentation with Trichoderma reesei QMY-1 (Chahal
1985 ). The overall process economy would be cheaper
by employing SSF for enzyme production using cheapsubstrates like agricultural residues. The SSF system
offers numerous advantages over SMF system, includ-
ing high volumetric productivity, relatively higherconcentration of the products, less efﬂuent generation,
simpler fermentation equipment, etc.
Typical time course of cellulase activities
The fermentations of sugarcane bagasse by recombi-
nant strain Tahrir-25 and its parents were carried out
for different incubation periods (1–14 days) in order
to evaluate the effect on CMCase, FPase, andb-glucosidase activities at 30 /C176C and pH 5 (Fig. 1a–c).
Whereas Aspergillus sp. Merv70 (P3) showed little
CMCase or FPase activities during 14 days offermentation, it exhibited the highest b-glucosidase
productivity at the 4th day of fermentation. CMCaseactivity was detected at the 2nd day of Trichoderma
sp. Merv6 (P1) fermentation and it reached its
maximum at the 7th day (60.5 U gds
-1). However,
it was not detected during the 1st and 2nd days of the
Penicillium sp. Merv2 (P2) fermentation. Thereafter,
the enzyme levels increased and reaching a maximumat the 9th day (32.16 U gds
-1). However, CMCase
activity was detected in the culture ﬁltrate of the
potent cellulolytic recombinant strain Tahrir-25 onthe ﬁrst day of fermentation and reached its maxi-
mum value at the 7th day of culture fermentation
(196.5 U gds
-1). Maximum FPase values (28.9, 16.2,
and 80.5 U gds-1) peaked at the 7th, 9th, and 8th
culture days with strains P1, P2, and Tahrir-25,
respectively. Both CMCase and FPase activitiesgradually decreased at longer incubation times for
such strains. Maximum b-glucosidase activities pro-
duced by P1, P2, P3, and Tahrir-25 strains were 10.6,17.2, 31.2, and 114 U gds
-1at the 7th, 9th, 4th, and
4th days of fermentation, respectively. The optimum
incubation period achieved by this step was ﬁxed forthe subsequent experiments. Further increase in the
incubation period led to a decrease in the production
of cellulase. This might be due to the depletion ofnutrients and production of other byproducts in the
fermentation medium (Haq et al. 2006 ). Whereas
FPase of T.harzianum T2008 achieved its maximum
level after 5 days of fermentation, cellulase activities
ofT. harzianum KM07 reached their maximum level
at 72 h (Haq et al. 2006 ).
Enzyme extraction
One of the major technical difﬁculties in solid-state
fermentation is the extraction or leaching of enzyme
from fermented materials, which is critical in deter-mining the economic feasibility of enzyme produc-
tion. In this study, citrate buffer (pH 5.0), phosphate

123buffer (pH 7.0), glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 10.0), NaCl
(1.0%), and the non-ionic surfactant Tween 80 (0.1,
0.2, and 0.3%) were compared for extraction andrecovery of cellulases from the solid fermentedslurries. Table 6shows that the CMCase, FPase, and
b-glucosidase recoveries were markedly enhanced to
235, 94, and 105 U gds
-1, respectively, when Tween
80 (0.2%) was used as leaching agent. This non-ionic
surfactant increases the extracellular protein accumu-
lation in culture ﬁltrates by enhancing the export ofproteins or enzymes through the cell membrane. In this
study, no acidic or alkaline leaching solutions gave
good results, presamably because they adversely affectenzyme activities. This ﬁnding is in agreement with
other studies in which maximum cellulase activities of
Aspergillus niger andTrichoderma reesei , as well as
keratinases from Penicillium sp.Morsy1, were
extracted from mold bran by 0.1% (w/v) Tween 80
(Lee et al. 2011 ; El-Gendy 2010 ). On the other hand,
citrate-phosphate buffer of 0.05 M and pH 4.8 was the
favored extractant for cellulases enzymes produced by
T. harzianum KM07 (Haq et al. 2006 ).
Effect of initial moisture content (IMC)
of the medium on cellulase activities
Moisture content is a critical factor for cell growth
and enzyme production under SSF, which determinesthe outcome of the process. As shown in Table 7, the
results indicated a positive relationship between
cellulase production and moisture when the watercontent was lower than 80%. The optimum initial
moisture level was 50–60, 60, and 60% for CMCase,
FPase, and b-glucosidase production (251, 103, and
137 U gds

123fusant on sugarcane bagasse. Lower or higher IMC
decreased cellulase production. The appropriate
moisture of substrate is one of the critical factorsinﬂuencing SSF and is governed by the requirements
of the microorganism. Lee et al. ( 2011 ) reported that
moisture content is a crucial factor in any SSFprocess because this variable inﬂuences growth and
biosynthesis of a microbe as well as secretion of
different metabolites such as enzymes. They found70% (w/w) moisture content to yield the highest
FPase activity of 2.3 U/g.
Effect of substrate particle size
Table 7clearly indicates that the particle size (speciﬁc
surface area) of sugarcane bagasse was a critical
factor in SSF for hyper-production of cellulases by the
recombinant fusant Tahrir-25. Maximum CMCase,FPase, and b-glucosidase production 287, 122.2, and
151 U gds

1.0 mm sized particles. A similar trend was reportedfor different fungi under SSF, i.e., cellulases fromTable 7 Optimization of solid state fermentation process

123wheat bran (Pandey 1991 ), cellulases from coir pith of
small particle size (Attyia and Ashour 2002 ) and
keratinase from rice straw by Penicillium sp. Morsy1
(El-Gendy 2010 ). Cellulases in this study were lower
with bigger or smaller particles than 1.0 mm. With
smaller particles, the surface area for growth is greaterbut the inter-particle porosity is less, whereas with
large size the porosity is greater but the saturated
surface area is less (El-Gendy 2010 ). Sugarcane
bagasse with 1.0 mm particle size probably provided
sufﬁcient surface area and aeration to the fungus for
growth resulting in increased cellulase production.
Effect of spore concentration
Inoculum size is a very important factor affecting cell
growth and product formation. The pattern of cellu-
lase production with respect to inoculum sizeindicated that with an increase in inoculum size,
Tahrir-25 strain showed the maximal CMCase,
FPase, and b-glucosidase production (293.6, 140,
and 169.4 U gds
-1) at a concentration of 106spores
g-1. Enzyme activities were sharply decreased when
inoculum size was out of this range (Table 7). Lower
inoculum size required a longer time for the cells to
multiply to a sufﬁcient number to utilize the substrate
and produce enzyme, but an increase in the number ofspores insured rapid proliferation and biomass syn-
thesis. A proper balance between the proliferating
biomass and available nutrients would yield anoptimum at which the enzyme synthesis would be
maximal (Sun et al. 2010 ).
Effect of different ratios of sugarcane bagasse
and corncob
Whereas production of CMCase and FPase (322 and
159.2 U gds
-1, respectively) was maximal when a
mixture of sugarcane bagasse and corncob were usedas a carbon source at a ratio of 2:1, the highest yield
ofb-glucosidase (179.9 U gds
-1) was obtained with
a ratio of 1:1 of sugarcane bagasse and corncob
(Table 7). Furthermore, a decrease in the production
of cellulase complexes resulted from the increase inthe amount of sugarcane bagasse or corncob. This
might be due to an increase in the level of substrates
decreasing the aeration and porosity of the mediumwhich would affect growth and production rates
(Bigelow and Wyman 2004 ).Effect of supplementation of sugarcane bagasse
with different carbon and nitrogen sources
As shown in Table 7addition of glucose signiﬁcantly
decreased CMCase, FPase, and b-glucosidase pro-
duction to 70, 29.2, and 35.5 U gds
-1, respectively.
A possible reason is that glucose acted as a catabolite
repressor and repressed enzyme formation (Sun et al.2010 ). Supplementation of carboxymethyl cellulose
improved cellulase complex production, CMCase,
FPase, and b-glucosidase to 356, 163.3, 190 U gds
-1.
Whereas lactose had a little effect on cellulose
production, Seiboth et al. ( 2005 ) found lactose to be
a good inducer of cellulase production by fungi.
Different organic nitrogen sources were added to
improve cellulase production. As shown in Table 7,a l l
tested nitrogen sources in this study enhanced cellulaseproduction by the recombinant fusant Tahrir-25 to
different levels. Among them, corn-steep solids were
the most appropriate supplement yielding cellulaseactivities of 399.4, 188.0, and 219.0 U gds
-1(CMCase,
FPase, and b-glucosidase, respectively). Although sug-
arcane bagasse can support the growth and cellulaseproduction of recombinant strain Tahrir-25, it may not
provide enough nutrients needed by the organism for
maximum enzyme production. Hence, the exogenousaddition of various nutrients to the medium may improve
cell growth and enzyme production due to the deﬁciency
of nitrogen sources in natural agricultural residues(El-Gendy 2010 ; El-Bondkly and El-Gendy 2010 ).
Effect of temperature and pH on cellulase
biosynthesis
The correlation between cellulase production and
incubation temperature as well as pH is shown in
Table 7. An incubation temperature of 30 /C176Cp r o v e dt o
be optimal for maximal CMCase, FPase, andb-glucosidase biosynthesis (417, 189.9, 220.2 U gds
-1,
respectively) by Tahrir-25 strain. Incubation at a
temperature lower than 30 /C176C affected cellulase produc-
tion negatively. This is due to the fact that incubation at
the lower temperatures resulted in a longer time to reach
maximum enzyme activity (Haq et al. 2006 ). The effect
of different incubation temperatures on cellulase pro-
duction by T.harzianum T2008 was studied by Lee et al.
(2011 ) with a peak at 30–32 /C176C.
Recombinant fusant Tahrir-25 yielded 450.1,
190.9, and 225.2 U gds-1of CMCase, FPase, andAntonie van Leeuwenhoek (2012) 101:331–346 343
123b-glucosidase, respectively, at pH 5.5. Cellulase
levels declined thereafter according to the initial
medium alkalinity (Table 7). This might be due to the
organism requiring acidic pH for growth and cellu-
lase production. Higher FPase and CMCase activities
were obtained from Trichoderma koningii AS3 after
84 h of incubation with an optimal moisture content
of 50%, a pH of 5.0 and an incubation temperature of
30/C176C (Liu and Yang 2007 ).
Determination of recombinant fusant Tahrir-25,
capability for formation of other hydrolyticenzymes
Recombinant fusant Tahrir-25 was found to be
capable of growing on agricultural residues and
producing a signiﬁcant level of various hydrolytic
depolymerizing enzymes. These enzymes hydrolysevarious lignocellulosic waste residues rich in cellu-
lose, hemicellulose, starch, xylan, and pectin. Such
enzymes could be important for the production ofsecond generation biofuels. These hydrolytic enzymes
were determined as reported by Bansal et al. ( 2011 ).
This enzyme cocktail, besides being a completecellulase complex, includes xylanase, mannase,
a-amylase, glucoamylase, and pectinase (1780, 200,
1715, 800, and 150 U gds
-1, respectively, in SSF and
195, 12.5, 240, 57, and 11.2 U gds-1in SMF,
respectively). Thus, this recombinant strain is a potent
hyper-cellulase producing strain and its hydrolyticcocktail of enzymes can be used for the complete
hydrolysis of different polysaccharides of plant origin
for the production of second generation biofuels. Thecoproduction of various hydrolytic enzymes in this
study from sugarcane bagasse and corncob may be
due to the presence of various inducing carbohydrates,including starch, xylan, glucan, arabinan, galactan,
mannan, and lignin in agricultural residues (Palmaro-
la-adrados et al. 2005 ). A cocktail of hydrolytic
enzymes has been previously reported from Ther-
momyces lanuginosus in submerged fermentation and
Sporotricum thermophile in solid state fermentation
(Bansal et al. 2011 ).
Estimation of alcohol in the selected pretreated
samples
After 7 days of sacchariﬁcation by P1, P2, P3, and
recombinant fusant Tahrir-25, it was followed byfermentation using a 10% volume of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae NRC2 of YM medium (3 g l
-1yeast
extract, 3 g l-1malt extract, 5 g l-1peptone,
10 g l-1glucose) and allowed to ferment for
5–10 days at a temperature of 37 /C176C. Data in Fig. 2
indicate that alcohol production is complete on the
7th day. Ethanol titer was 17, 12, 11, and 58 g l-1
after sacchariﬁcation of sugarcane bagasse by P1, P2,
P3, and recombinant fusant Tahrir-25, respectively. A
few studies have reported that consortia of fungalcultures or their enzyme preparations could be
employed for sacchariﬁcation of lignocellulosic
materials for ethanol production. In the study ofPatel et al. ( 2007 ), different fungal cultures, including
Aspergillus niger ,Aspergillus awamori ,Trichoderma
ressei ,Trichoderma viride ,Phanerochaete chrysos-
porium , and Pleurotus sajor -caju were used in
different combinations for release of sugars for
ethanol production.
Conclusion
Our results show that intergeneric protoplast fusion is
a useful tool in genetic improvement programs togenerate better cellulolytic strains. These could be
useful to utilize different agriculture residues as a
cheap substrate for cellulase biosynthesis. Accordingto the results obtained in this study, we recommend
endophytic fungi and their recombinants for indus-
trial application in combination with simultaneoushydrolysis and fermentation of lignocellulose. This
system should certainly lower the price of ethanol
produced from lignocellulosic biomass.0102030405060
