Abstract The present study was set to develop a robust and
economic biorefinery process for continuous co-production of
ethanol and xylitol from rice straw in a membrane bioreactor.
Acid pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, detoxification, yeast
strains selection, single and co-culture batch fermentation, and
finally continuous co-fermentation were optimized. The com-
bination of diluted acid pretreatment (3.5 %) and enzymaticconversion (1:10 enzyme (63 floating-point unit (FPU)/mL)/
biomass ratio) resulted in the maximum sugar yield (81 %
conversion). By concentrating the hydrolysates, sugars levelincreased by threefold while that of furfural reduced by 50 %
(0.56 to 0.28 g/L). Combined application of active carbon and
resin led to complete removal of furfural, hydroxyl methylfurfural, and acetic acid. The strains Saccharomyces
cerevisiae NCIM 3090 with 66.4 g/L ethanol production and
Candida tropicalis NCIM 3119 with 9.9 g/L xylitol produc-
tion were selected. The maximum concentrations of ethanol
and xylitol in the single cultures were recorded at 31.5 g/L
(0.42 g/g yield) and 26.5 g/L (0.58 g/g yield), respectively. Inthe batch co-culture system, the ethanol and xylitol produc-
tions were 33.4 g/L (0.44 g/g yield) and 25.1 g/L (0.55 g/g
yield), respectively. The maximum ethanol and xylitol volu-metric productivity values in the batch co-culture system were65 and 58 % after 25 and 60 h, but were improved in thecontinuous co-culture mode and reached 80 % (55 g/L) and68 % (31 g/L) at the dilution rate of 0.03 L per hour, respec-
tively. Hence, the continuous co-production strategy devel-
oped in this study could be recommended for producing
value-added products from this hugely generated lignocellu-
losic waste.
Introduction
Rice straw is known as one of the major and also abundantlignocellulosic wastes with annual production of about 731
million tons distributed in Africa, Asia, Europe, and
America (Balat 2011; Cheng and Timilsina 2011). The annual
production of rice straw in Iran alone is about 6 million tons
per year out of which more than 50 % remains unprocessed
and is subjected to open burning in rice fields. During the lastdecades, the biorefinery of such lignocelluloses materials for
production of high-value products and bioenergy has gained a
great deal of attention. More specifically, lignocellulosic bio-mass could be converted into energy, biochemicals, and
bioproducts with higher economic values such as bioethanol,
methanol, hydrogen, xylitol, organic acids, organic solvents,yeasts, amino acids, animal feed, etc (Ma et al. 2009 ;R i n a l d i
and Schüth 2009 ; Binod et al. 2010; Cherubini 2010;
Cherubini and Ulgiati 2010; Edama et al. 2014; Pothiraj
et al. 2015 ; Salehi Jouzani and Taherzadeh 2015 ). However,
a robust and efficient bioprocess development is requiredsince these heterogeneous materials show very high resistance
to chemical and biological hydrolysis (Kumar et al. 2009 ;
Galbe and Zacchi 2012 ).
Among various products, production of bioethanol and xy-
litol from lignocellulosic biomass has comparatively attracted
more attention (Horiuchi et al. 2010 ; Franceschin et al. 2011;

Ali et al. 2012 ). Bioethanol is known as the most important
liquid biofuel blended with gasoline and is also used as a
valuable raw material for production of other valuablechemicals (McMillan 1997 ; Kim and Dale 2004 ; Haghighi
Mood et al. 2013a ,b). Xylitol is a natural five-carbon sugar
alcohol which has sucrose-like sweetness and is used as low-calorie sweetener in food industry for production of different
food products such as gum, chocolate, and baking products. In
addition, due to its low absorption in digestive tracts, xylitolhas a great market in the pharmaceutical industry in particular
for diabetic patients (Emodi 1978 ; Granström et al. 2007 ;d e
Jong et al. 2012 ). The price of xylitol (3.4 –3.9 USD per kg) in
market is much higher than that of ethanol ( ∼1U S Dp e rk g )
(Zha et al. 2013 ).
One of the most important obstacles of bioethanol produc-
tion from lignocellulosic materials is high cost and low effi-ciency of the process. This is caused by the complexity and
high cost of pretreatment, hydrolysis, fermentation, and dehy-dration process. Lignocellulose material such as rice straw
contain three kinds of polymers namely cellulose, hemicellu-
loses, and lignin which are made of pentose sugars like xyloseand arabinose and hexose sugars like glucose, mannose, and
galactose (Haghighi Mood et al. 2013a ,b). Hence, two groups
of C6 and C5 simple sugars are produced during the hydroly-sis process of lignocellulosic materials. Most microorganisms
are only capable of C6 sugars fermentation, and in spite of thehigh concentration of C5 sugars (such as xylose) in the hydro-
lysates, a small numbers of microorganisms are able to fer-
ment these sugars (Hendriks and Zeeman 2009; Morales-
Rodriguez et al. 2011; Heredia-Olea et al. 2015). Pichia ,
Debaryomyces ,a n dCandida are microorganisms capable of
converting xylose to xylitol, and other microorganisms likeSaccharomyces can efficiently produce ethanol from glucose
(da Cunha-Pereira et al. 2011; Huang et al. 2011;M a r t í n e z
et al. 2012 ). Recently, biorefinery technologies have been tak-
en into account as one of the hopeful strategies to reduce the
cost of process via production of different valuable by-
products from lignocellulosic biomass beside bioethanol.Co-culture of different microorganisms with capabilities of
C6 and C5 fermentation and uniform growth is among such
technologies (e.g., Chen 2011;S u r i y a c h a ie ta l .2013 ; Wang
et al. 2014 ). Combined production of ethanol and xylitol has
been regarded as a potential and promising approach in orderto improve the economic viability of biomass conversion(Huang et al. 2011; Prakash et al. 2011; Zha et al. 2013 ). In
addition, membrane bioreactors (MBRs), using cross-flowmicro-filters or ultra-filter hollow fiber modules with cellrecycling, have been recently used for continuously removal
of fermentation products (Rado čaj and Diosady 2014).
Development of continuous co-culture systems, i.e., continu-
ous substrate feeding and continuous ethanol and xylitol re-
moval, in order to reduce products ’inhib
itory effect could
improve the ethanol and xylitol volumetric productivity.MBRs could increase cell concentrations in the bioreactorextensively, while also reduce product inhibition during the
biological process. Subsequently, these bioreactors increaseproduct concentration and productivity and simplify the sep-
aration of product and/or cells. Various MBRs have been stud-
ied over the last years, where the membrane is either sub-merged inside the liquid to be filtered or placed in an external
loop outside the bioreactor (Ylitervo et al. 2013 ). Recent stud-
ies have proven the great potential of MBRs for improving the
robustness of the lingo-ethanol production (Dereli et al. 2014 ;
Rado čaj and Diosady 2014 ; Ylitervo et al. 2013 ,2014 ).
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop a robustbioprocess for the first time for continuous co-production of
ethanol and xylitol from rice straw hydrolysate in an MBR
sustaining all the abovementioned attributes.
Materials and methods
Materials
Rice straw was obtained from rice farms located in the north-
ern regions of Iran (Rasht). The rice straw composition was
determined according to the method previously described byLiu et al. ( 2009 ). The chemical composition of the rice straw
used in this study included 34.5 % hemicelluloses, 46 % cel-lulose, 16.2 % lignin, and 3.3 % ash. Rice straw commonlycontains about 40 % glucan, 15.0 % xylan, 1 % galactan, and
3 % arabinan, ( w/w) (Sharma et al. 2015 ; Sluiter et al. 2008 ).
Cellulase enzyme (C2730), glucose, xylose, xylitol, furfural,
5-hydroxyl methyl furfural (HMF), activated carbon, and an-
ionic exchange resin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Poole, Dorset, UK).
Rice straw cleaning and drying
Rice straw was cut into pieces 1 –2 cm in length and thorough-
ly washed with tap water until the effluent became clear and
colorless. Then, biomass was dried at 55 °C for 24 h in an
oven. The temperature treatment (55 °C for 24 h) was selected
due to its high drying efficiency and in order to prevent mi-crobial growth after drying (Colom et al. 2003 ; Sewalt et al.
1997 ; Yin et al. 2001 ; Iwamoto et al. 2005 ). The moisture
content of dried straw was about 12 –14 % w/w,e n s u r i n gt h e
prevention of any microbial contaminations. Finally, the rice
straw was ground to particles of 5 to 7 mm and kept at room
temperature (Fig. 1).
Preparation of rice straw hemicelluloses hydrolysate
Pretreatment of rice straw and preparation of rice straw hemi-
celluloses hydrolysate were conducted by using different di-
lute concentrations of sulfuric acid (2, 3.5, and 5 %) at 100 °CFolia Microbiolfor 30 min to hydrolyze hemicellulose and to remove lignin
(Fig. 1). After hydrolysis, the solid residues were separated by
centrifugation at 8500 rpm for 15 min. The solid phaseremained after acidic hydrolysis was washed several timeswith fresh water and was dried at 60 °C for 24 h to reach a
humidity level of approximately 5 %. After drying, it was
ground to particles of 250 –425μm( 3 5 –65 mesh) to increase
enzymatic hydrolysis efficacy. The liquid phase was concen-
trated threefold by evaporation under vacuum at 70 °C to
achieve 45 g/L xylose concentrations. Each treatment wasrepeated three times.
Detoxification of hemicelluloses hydrolysate
To detoxify the hemicellulose hydrolysate, the pH of the con-
centrated hydrolysate was increased to 7 using CaO followed
by filtration to remove solid maters, and the pH of the solution
was then re-adjusted to 5.5 using sulfuric acid. The obtained
solution was kept at 4 °C for 24 h and was then centrifuged to
remove precipitates. Subsequently, the concentrated hydroly-sate was incubated with 3 % activated carbon for 60 min in a
1000-mL container (30 °C and 100 rpm). Then, the liquid
phase was separated using filtration and analyzed for totalsugars. In addition, to complete the removal process of inhib-
itors like acetic acid, ion exchange resins were used (Fig. 1).
To optimize the efficiency of the resins for detoxification and
inhibitors reduction, a cylinder column (inner diameter of
5 cm and length of 60 cm) was filled with the resins, the
filtrate obtained from the activated carbon adsorption stepwas passed through the column using a vacuum pump at dif-
ferent rates (5, 10, 15, and 20mL/min), and then the final
concentration of acetic acid was measured by HPLC. Theresults showed that the best rate was 10 mL/min, so this rate
was used in the experiments (data not shown). Finally, the
detoxified hydrolysate was separated using filtration, andanalyzed for total sugars and their loss during inhibitor remov-al process.
Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic residueEnzymatic hydrolysis of the rice straw cellulosic residue was
performed using a commercial cellulase enzyme (C2730,Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The solid phase remained after
acid hydrolysis was hydrolyzed using a cellulase enzyme so-
lution in citrate buffer (pH=5) with an activity of 63 floating-point unit (FPU)/mL in 1:10 enzyme/biomass ratio (5 mL
enzyme/50 g biomass and 950 mL citrate buffer) (Fig. 1).
Briefly, the solid residues were mixed with the enzyme solu-
tion at 1:10 ratio and the resulting suspension was agitated
(100 rpm) at 45 °C and for 72 h. The solution obtained from
this procedure was kept at −20 °C until the fermentation pro-
cess. Cellulase activity of the enzyme solution was measured
according to the method described by Biely et al. ( 1985 )) as
FPU.
Screening of different yeast strains for ethanol and xylitol
fermentation
SixSaccharomyces cerevisiae strains, including NCIM 3125,
NCIM 3283, NCIM 3090, NCIM 3300, NCIM 3494, and
NCIM 3570, were screened for bioethanol production. One
Candida tropicalis strain (NCIM 3119) and four Candida
guilliermondii strains, including NCIM 3125, NCIM 3126,
NCIM 3127, and NCIM 3399, were also screened for xylitolproduction. All the strains were maintained at −80 °C in cul-
ture aliquots containing 20 % sterile glycerol and revived at
30 °C before starting the experiments using a medium com-
posed of yeast extract, 3 g/L; malt extract, 3 g/L; peptone, 5 g/L; and glucose, 70 g/L (for Candida strains,
D-xylose, 10 g/L)
(Sanchez et al. 2008 ). To screen the strains with high poten-
tials for ethanol and xylitol production, the S. cerevisiae and
Fig. 1 The schematic diagram for the process used in the present study for continuous co-production of bioethanol and xylitol from rice strawFolia MicrobiolCandida strains were cultured on 140 g/L glucose and 20 g/L
xylose (as carbon source), respectively. Other components of
the media were yeast extract (10 g/L), rice bran extract(20 % V/V), diammonium sulfate (5 g/L), and calcium chlo-
ride (0.1 g/L). The strains were incubated at 30 °C and
200 rpm for 4 days.
Optimization of nitrogen source and oxygen concentration
for co-production of ethanol and xylitol
To optimize nitrogen source for co-culture of the selected
strains of Saccharomyces andCandida , four organic nitrogen
source, including malt extract, yeast extract, bacto-tryptone,
and casein, and four mineral nitrogen source, including am-
monium chloride, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, andammonium molybdate (6 g/L), were used. Other components
of the medium were as follow: glucose (50 g/L), xylose (40 g/
L), and calcium chloride (0.1 g/L). The selected strains wereincubated at 30 °C and 200 rpm for 5 days. Then, the concen-
tration of the nitrogen sources used was optimized.
To determine the optimum concentration of oxygen for
co-culture of the selected strains of Saccharomyces and
Candida at batch fermentor level, four different concen-
trations, i.e. 5, 10, 20, and 30 %, were considered. The
components of the medium were as follows: glucose
(80 g/L), xylose (40 g/L), yeast extract (10 g/L), and
diammonium sulfate (5 g/L). The selected strains were
also added to 1.5 L of the autoclaved medium (121 °C,
15 min) at the same concentration, and the experiments
were conducted in a 2-L stirred tank bioreactor (BioFlo310, New Brunswick, USA). The bioreactor culture con-
ditions were controlled automatically at 300 rpm agita-
tion, 30
/C14C, pH 5, and air flow rate of 0.5 vvm. During
the fermentation process, the pH of culture media wascontrolled by NaOH (3 mol/L) and HCL (3 mol/L) for72 h. In addition, all processing parameters were moni-
tored and recorded by the Biocommand Bioprocessing
Software (New Brunswick, USA).
Batch fermentation of rice straw hydrolysates
for production of ethanol and xylitol
(single and co-culture)
To evaluate the efficiency of single and co-culture of the se-
lected strains for ethanol and xylitol productions, 60 mL of the
media containing the selected strains (single or co-culture)
was added to 1.5 L of the autoclaved medium, containingthe concentrated and detoxified hydrolysate of rice straw
(75 g/L glucose and 40 g/L xylose), yeast extract (10 g/L),
and diammonium sulfate (5 g/L) and transferred to a 2-Lstirred tank bioreactor (BioFlo 310, New Brunswick, USA).
The bioreactor culture conditions and pH were controlled as
previously mentioned. To enhance the ethanol and xylitolproduction, during the first and second 20 h, oxygen concen-
tration was adjusted at 5 and 10 %, respectively. In addition,
all processing parameters were monitored and recorded aspreviously mentioned.
Optimization of dilution rate for continuous co-production
of ethanol and xylitol
To optimize the dilution rate in the continuous fermentation of
the selected yeast strains in order to enhance co-production of
ethanol and xylitol, the selected strains were added to 3 L of
the autoclaved medium, containing the concentrated and de-toxified hydrolysate of rice straw (75 g/L glucose and 40 g/L
xylose), yeast extract (10 g/L), and diammonium sulfate (5 g/
L), and the mixture was then transferred to a 5-L stirred tankbioreactor (BioFlo 310, New Brunswick, USA). Three dilu-
tion rates including 0.03, 0.06, and 0.09 L per hour were used
using a peristaltic pump. Fermentation was performed at30 °C, pH 5, and 300 rpm. The pH was controlled using
3 mol/L NaOH and 3 mol/L HCL.
Continuous fermentation of rice straw hydrolysates
for co-production of ethanol and xylitol
Continuous fermentation for co-production of ethanol and xy-
litol was performed by coupling a cross-flow microfiltration
unit (pore size, 0.45 μm, 0.1 m
2surface area, Sartorius,
Germany) with a 5-L stirred tank bioreactor (BioFlo 310,
New Brunswick, USA). Both strains were added to 3 L of
the autoclaved containing the concentrated and detoxified hy-drolysate of rice straw (75 g/L glucose and 40 g/L xylose),
yeast extract (10 g/L), and diammonium sulfate (5 g/L), and
the mixture was then transferred to the bioreactor.Fermentation was performed at 30 °C, pH 5, and 300 rpm.
The pH was controlled using 3 mol/L NaOH and 3 mol/L
HCL solutions. The dilution rate was set to 0.03 L/h, and the
media was aseptically recirculated by peristaltic pumps.
Continuous cultivation was started when approximately allglucose and xylose contents in the media were consumed
(70 h after starting fermentation).
Biochemical analysis
The concentration of glucose, xylose, ethanol, and xylitol in
all experiments was analyzed by a HPLC (Knauer, Germany)
equipped with a RIK-2301 refractive index detector and a
Eurokat H polymeric column (Knauer, Germany), at 60 °C.Samples were eluted using H
2SO4(0.01 N) as the mobile
phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and sample peaks wereidentified using the refractive index detector. For determiningfurfural and HMF contents, samples were first eluted with
acetonitrile: water (1:8) and 1 % acetic acid and HPLC mea-
surements were performed at a 0.8 mL/min flow rate using aFolia MicrobiolHewlett-Packard RP18 column, at 25 °C and a UV –vis detec-
tor (SPD-10A UV –vis). All the chemicals were HPLC grade.
Kinetics of cell growth
Cell growth was monitored during fermentations by online
measuring of culture turbidity using a turbidity transmitter
equipped with a fiber optic sensor (Trb8300, Mettler-Toledo,
Switzerland), and the data obtained were correlated with cell
dry mass through a calibration curve.
Statistical analysis
All the results presented herein are the mean (mean±standard
error) of three replicates. Analysis of variance, mean compar-
ison, and treatment groups ’score were obtained using the SAS
software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, version 9.1 for personal
computer) and the Duncan Multiple test at P≤0.05.
Results and discussion
The results obtained on pretreatment using different concen-trations of sulfuric acid are presented in Table 1.A ss h o w n ,
increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid caused a signifi-cant increase in the glucose and inhibitor contents, whereas itdid not significantly affect the xylose content (Table 1). For
instance, when the concentration of sulfuric acid was in-creased from 2 to 3.5 %, the glucose content critically andsignificantly increased, whereas the inhibitors contents did
not vary significantly. By further increasing the sulfuric acid
concentration from 3.5 to 5 %, the increases in glucose and
xylose contents were not significant (Table 1). Hence, 3.5 %
sulfuric acid (resulting in 2.3 and 15.05 g/L glucose and xy-
lose production, respectively) was selected as the optimum
concentration for the pretreatment step. Among the growth
inhibitors, acetic acid had the highest concentration (3.9 g/L ) ,f o l l o w e db yf u r f u r a l( 0 . 5 6g / L )a n dH M F( 0 . 1 7g / L ) .
Furfural is produced through the hydrolysis of pentose sugars
in acidic environment. Due to the high quantity of pentosesugars obtained in acidic hydrolysis, the concentration of fur-
fural was also higher in the hydrolysates. In general, acetic
acid and furan components are one of the most importantinhibitors of microbial production of ethanol and xylitol from
lignocelluloses (Wahlbom and Hahn –Hägerdal 2002 ;L ie ta l .
2009 ;T a n ge ta l . 2011).
The hydrolysate was concentrated under vacuum up to
threefold to increase the xylose and glucose contents.
Table 2tabulates the concentration of these two sugars as well
as the inhibitors contained in the rice straw hydrolysate.
During the concentration stage, the level of glucose and xy-
lose increased by almost threefold (7 and 46.2 g/L, respective-ly), while that of furfural reduced by 50 % (0.28 g/L).
Moreover, the concentrations of acetic acid and HMF in-
creased up to 46 and 82 %, respectively, which were signifi-cantly less compared to the increase obtained for the sugars.
The reduction of furfural concentration must have been caused
by the volatility of furfural at high temperatures. Many studieshave shown that furfural could be almost completely removed
from hydrolysate through concentration (Palmqvist and Hahn-
Hägerdal 2000 ; Wahlbom and Hahn –Hägerdal 2002 ).
Pretreatment and hydrolysis results revealed that the com-
bination of dilute acid pretreatment (3.5 %, 100 °C, 30 min)and enzymatic conversion using 1:10 biomass/enzyme solu-
tion (12 FPU) ratio led to the highest sugar yield (81 % con-
version). Therefore, such combination could be suggested forefficient hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose content of
rice straw to produce fermentable sugars like glucose and
xylose. Similar results have been also reported by other re-search groups on hydrolysis of rice straw, wheat, and corn
lignocellulosic wastes (Saha et al. 2005 ; Hsu et al. 2010 ;
Avci et al. 2013 ).
To detoxify the hydrolysate, activated carbon and resins
were used. By application of the activated carbon, the concen-
tration of furfural and HM F reduced to 0 %, but the

initial value. However, when a combination of both methods,
i.e., activated carbon and resins was used, the concentration ofacetic acid shrank to 0 % as well, while the concentrations of
glucose (6.7 g/L) and xylose (45 g/L) were not affected sig-
nificantly (Table 3).
The screening results for S. cerevisiae strains concerning
their ethanol production showed that they had significantlydifferent potentials for ethanol production ranging from 51.2to 66.4 g/L. The maximum ethanol production was achieved
by the strain NCIM 3090 with 66.4 g/L ethanol and 0.47 g/L
per hour (Yp/s) ethanol production efficiency (Table 4). The
Candida strains also showed significantly different potential
for xylitol production (7.1 –9.9 g/L), and the maximum xylitol
production was achieved by the strain C. tropicalis NCIM
3119 with 9.9 g/L xylitol and 0.49 g/L per hour (Yp/s) xylitol
production efficiency (Table 5). To determine the suitable type
of nitrogen source for co-production of ethanol and xylitol,
both yeast strains were co-cultured on different media contain-
ing one of the eight different organic or mineral nitrogen
sources. The results confirmed that different nitrogen sourcespossessed significantly different biorefinery efficiency, and
the maximum ethanol (24.41 g/L), xylitol (22.7 g/L), and bio-
mass (13.24 g/L) production was achieved when yeast extract
was used as the sole nitrogen source. The optimum concen-
tration of the yeast extract resulting in the maximum ethanol,xylitol, and biomass production was also obtained at 15 g/L
yeast extract. Similar results were also obtained when 10 g/L
yeast extract in combination with 5 g/L diammonium sulfatewas used (data was not shown). Hence and from the econom-
ical point of view, 10 g/L yeast extract and 5 g/L diammonium
sulfate were used for the next experiments.
Both C. tropicalis andS. cerevisiae shift between oxidative
and oxydo-reductive or reductive modes depending on differ-ent levels of O
2available for their metabolism. This, i.e., ox-
ygen level, could play an important role in the respiratory
chain and the requirements for NADH or NADPH co-factors
and thus could impact the carbon distribution among biomass,ethanol, and xylitol production pathways. As a result, in thepresent study, optimization of oxygen concentration (5 –30 %)
for co-production of ethanol and xylitol was also performed
during the co-culture of both strains. The maximum ethanol
production of 38 g/L was achieved when the dissolved oxygenlevel was set at 5 %, whereas the maximum xylitol production
of 21.6 g/L was achieved when the dissolved oxygen level
was set at 10 %. The oxygen concentrations of 5 and 10 %were selected as the best oxygen levels for co-production of
xylitol and ethanol by co-culture of the studied yeasts. To
achieve this, at the first stage of the fermentation in whichglucose was consumed, the concentration of oxygen was ad-
justed at 5 %, then 10 % was used for the stage in which
xylose was generated by C. tropicalis .
In the next experiments, the production of ethanol and xy-

20th hour. Maximum concentration of ethanol was obtained at
the 18th hour of growth, and by this time, all the glucosecontent contained in the medium (75 g/L) was consumed by
S. cerevisiae. The maximum concentration of ethanol
achieved under single culture condition was as much as31.5 g/L with a yield of 0.42 g/g and volumetric
productivity of 1.65 g/L per hour. These values were
significantly higher than those of the study conducted Yadavet al. ( 2011) in which they reported an ethanol yield of 0.3 g/g
with a volumetric productivity of 0.2 g/L per hour usingS. cerevisiae (OVB 11) and rice straw hydrolysate.
Moreover, in the single culture of C. tropicalis , the lag
phase continued till the fifth hour, and after that, the log phasestarted and continued until the 40th hour. The production ofxylitol was not significant until the eighth hour, but sharply
increased afterwards, and reached its maximum concentration
at around the 50th hour (Fig. 3). By this time, all the xylose
content contained in the medium (45 g/L) was consumed by
C. tropicalis . The maximum xylitol concentration achieved
was 26.5 g/L, and the yield and volumetric productivity values
were at 0.58 and 0.53 g/L per hour, respectively (Fig. 3).
The growth rates using batch co-culture of C. tropicalis and
S. cerevisiae were significantly different from those obtained
in the single cultures (Fig. 4, Table 6). The total microbial
biomass production was significantly more in the co-culturesystem (19.9 g/L) than in the single cultures (about 11.8 –
11.95 g/L). At the beginning of the fermentation process underthe co-culture condition, only slight xylose consumption andxylitol production were observed and both yeasts preferred to
consume glucose and produce ethanol (Fig. 4). This is as-
cribed to the fact that microorganisms in culture media gener-
ally consume hexoses more easily and rapidly than pentoses.
Therefore, as shown in Fig. 4, during the first 18 h of growth,
C. tropicalis used xylose at a low rate and produced a small
quantity of xylitol while it mainly consumed glucose and pro-duced ethanol but right after that and when the glucose source
was used up, it switched to the consumption of xylose andcontinued till the pentose concentration reached zero at around
60 h. Hence, this delay in consumption of xylose can be at-
tributed to this point that C. tropicalis preferred to use glucose
at first, and then by consumption of glucose, the yeast started
to uptake xylose.
Moreover, the consumption of xylose by C. tropicalis was
kinetically slower than the rate on glucose due to the lessaffinity and/or NADH or NADPH requirements to transform
xylose into xylulose, which is often the limiting step. As it isobserved in Fig. 4, the majority of the microbial biomass was
generated through the consumption of glucose during the firsthours which subsequently resulted in ethanol production byboth yeasts, whereas xylitol production was due to the biocon-
version of xylose only done by C. tropicalis . The observedTable 6 Kinetic parameters for production of ethanol and xylitol from rice straw hydrolysate by separate culture and co-culture in the batch fermentor

by the fact that both S. cerevisiae andC. tropicalis could
simultaneously consume glucose, and depending on the oxy-
gen consumption, the carbon flux could be preferentially di-
rected to growth and/or to ethanol production.
In the co-culture experiments conducted herein, the maxi-
mum concentration of ethanol of 33.4 g/L was obtained at16 h of growth, but the maximum concentration of xylitol

Comparison of the results of ethanol and xylitol yields and
volumetric productivity in the single and co-cultures showed
that in the co-culture system, ethanol yield increased from0.42 to 0.44 g/g whereas xylitol yield decreased from 0.58
to 0.55 g/g, but these variations were not significantly differ-
ent compared to the values obtained in the single cultures(Table 6). This confirmed that the co-culture of both yeasts
resulted in the same ethanol and xylitol quantities as the singlecultures, and there was no inhibitory effect on the yield of bothproducts. The maximum ethanol and xylitol volumetric pro-
ductivity in the batch co-culture system was 65 and 58 % after
16 and 60 h, respectively, but after that, their production ratesreduced. However, the volumetric productivity of ethanol sig-
nificantly increased in the co-culture system, whereas that ofxylitol decreased (Table 6). These results could be indicative
of synergistic effects of simultaneous cultivation of both
yeasts on ethanol production and the inhibitory effects on
xylitol production. There are different reports on the produc-
tion of ethanol in co-culture such as that of Yadav et al. ( 2011)
in which they used co-culture of S. cerevisiae andP . stipitis in
rice hydrolysate but achieved comparatively lower concentra-tion of ethanol (12 g/L) and ethanol yield (0.4 g/g) than thevalues obtained in this study. However, their findings were in
agreement with those of this study that the co-culture condi-
tion compared to separate cultures resulted in higher ethanolconcentration, yield, and volumetric productivity. In the con-
trary, Latif and Rajoka ( 2001 )) reported lower concentration
of ethanol (21 g/L) with ethanol yield of 0.19 g/g and volu-metric productivity of 0.22 g /L per hour in co-culture of
S. cerevisiae andC. tropicalis in corn cob hydrolysate in com-
parison with their single cultures. Their findings were alsoconfirmed by those of another study in which higher concen-
tration of xylitol was obtained using C. tropicalis single cul-
ture in corn cob hydrolysate with xylitol production of 21 g/L,
yield of 0.45 g/g, and volumetric productivity of 0.22 g/L per
hour while co-culture of both S. cerevisiae andC. tropicalis

et al. ( 2008 )a l s ou s e dm i x t u r e so f D-glucose and D-xylose and
could produce a total amount of 0.56 g/g ethanol and xylitol
byC. tropicalis NBRC 0618 which was less than the total
ethanol and xylitol yield achieved in the present study. As
mentioned earlier, the advantage of co-culture fermentation
is that by using this method, hexoses and pentose sugars
could be simultaneously converted to ethanol and xylitol.Recently, Zha et al. ( 2013 ) attempted to consolidate both ca-
pabilities by cloning of CDT-1(encoding a cellodextrin trans-
porter), gh1-1(encoding an intracellular β-glucosidase), and
XYL1 (encoding a xylose reductase that converts xylose into
xylitol) into S. cerevisiae and could achieve a balanced co-
fermentation of cellobiose (0.165 g/L per hour) and xylose(0.162 g/L per hour) at similar rates to co-produce ethanol
(0.36 g/g) and xylitol (1.00 g/g).
In the present study, three different dilution rates (0.03,
0.06, and 0.09 L per hour) were also evaluated for continuousfermentation. It was shown that the maximum ethanol (37.8 g/
L), xylitol (24.2 g/L), and biomass (20.1 g/L) production wasobserved when the dilution rate of 0.03 L per hour was used.
At this dilution rate, all glucose and xylose contents were
continuously used by the strains, whereas in the other dilata-
tion rates, the production efficiency was less, and glucose and
xylose were partially accumulated without consumption dur-ing the process (Table 7). The results of the continuous co-
culture fermentation of the selected yeasts in the 5-L stirredtank bioreactor coupled to a cross-flow microfiltration unit at30 °C, pH 5, 300 rpm, and dilution rate of 0.03 L per hour
showed that ethanol and xylitol could be steadily co-produced
using the membrane bioreactor up to 150 h of fermentation(Fig. 5). The medium used in this experiment contained con-
centrated and detoxified hydrolysate of rice straw (75 g/Lglucose and 40 g/L xylose), yeast extract (10 g/L), anddiammonium sulfate (5 g/L), and oxygen concentration was
set at 5 –10 % in the order described earlier.
More specifically, ethanol and xylitol production rates were
constantly and greatly improved in the continuous culturemode up to 150 h and reached as high as 80 and 68 % for
ethanol and xylitol, respectively. In addition, no metabolicshift and membrane fouling was observed after 150 h of cul-
tivation. In other words, the concentrations of ethanol and
xylitol reached 55 g/L (yield of 0.70 g/g) and 31 g/L (yieldof 0.78 g/g) at the 150th hour, respectively, which were sig-
nificantly higher than those obtained in the batch single and
co-culture systems (Fig. 6).
Numerous studies have previously emphasized on the ad-
vantages of continuous production of ethanol and thereforestrived to produce ethanol from different biomass by usingdifferent continuous fermen tation systems, such as cell
recycling or/and in situ ethanol removal (e.g., Zhang et al.2005 ;C h e ne ta l . 2012 ; Ntihuga et al. 2012 ), modeling or/and optimizing different fermentation parameters (e.g.,
Amillastre et al. 2012 ; Khongsay et al. 2012 ; Sharma and
Rangaiah 2012 ), and using different fermentor designs and
fermentation techniques (e.g., Ding et al. 2011 ; Kundiyana
et al. 2011;M o o ne ta l . 2012 ). Our results also proved the
great advantage of continuous co-production of ethanol and
xylitol from rice straw feedstock over batch single production.
The application of continuous co-culture systems would re-
duce the overall production costs, as different types of valu-able materials could be produced simultaneously such as eth-
anol and xylitol in the present study, and moreover, higher
products concentrations could be achieved in comparison withbatch single cultures.
Conclusion
A biorefinery process, including pretreatment, enzymatic hy-drolysis, detoxification, yeast strains, and continuous fermen-tation, was used for co-production of ethanol and xylitol from
rice straw. The continuous co-culture of the yeasts on rice
straw hydrolysate could significantly increase the ethanoland xylitol yields compared to the single batch cultures.
More detailed studies and also development of new technolo-
gies may open a new road for economic co-production ofvalue-added products from this hugely generated lignocellu-
losic waste (rice straw).
