The isolation of autochthonous yeast species presents a good strategy to select new microorganisms for devel -
oping an adequate inoculum to carry out fermentations and generate representative products of the cider pro-
duction zone. However, non-Saccharomyces yeasts have been considered to have low capacity to carry out a 
complete fermentation as Saccharomyces cerevisiae . In this work, five autochthonous yeasts from a cider 
fermentation process were isolated and identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Kluyveromyces marxianus , Pichia 
membranaefaciens , P. kluyveri and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii . A series of fermentations were developed at labo-
ratory level, using each species individually and it was observed that only S. cerevisiae was able to finish the 
process. K. marxianus consumed less than 50% of the sugars; P. kluyveri and Z. rouxii consumed less than 70% and 
P. membranaefaciens consumed more than 90% but the yield (ethanol produced for sugar consumed (YP/S)) was 
0.39. Nevertheless, the addition of magnesium, zinc and nitrogen increased the fermentative capacity of almost 
all species: K. marxianus , Z. rouxii and P. kluyveri , showed an increase in ethanol production when nutrients were 
added, obtaining more than 80 g/L of ethanol, and showing that those nutrients are necessary to complete the 
fermentation. This work describes the potential use of different non-Saccharomyces species to carry out 
fermentation of apple juice and highlights the importance of certain nutrients to enable an efficient alcoholic 
fermentation and the generation of desirable volatile compounds for cider production.   
1.Introduction 
Traditional cider is defined as the product of a spontaneous 
fermentation of apple juice. This process involves an alcoholic fermen -
tation and a malolactic fermentation accomplished by the sequential 
action of different autochthonous yeasts and bacteria, both from the 
fruit and from the factory equipment where they are processed (Cab-
ranes et al., 1990 ; Due~nas et al., 1994 ; Salih et al., 1988 ). The apple juice 
contains proteins, fat and carbohydrates, where sugars are the largest 
components of soluble solids of apples. The main types of sugars are 
fructose, glucose and sucrose. Apple juice shows an average total con-
tent of reducing sugars of 120 g/L (Braga et al., 2013 ; Thacker and 
Schug, 2020 ). 
The chemical composition of cider is established through three 
fermentative stages, which occur in parallel and sequentially: the 
oxidative (mainly non-Saccharomyces yeasts), the alcoholic (mainly Saccharomyces spp.) and the malolactic (lactic acid bacteria, LAB) 
fermentation (Dierings et al., 2013 ). As in the case of grape wines, it is 
known that some non-Saccharomyces yeasts can contribute noticeably to 
cider quality by forming certain metabolites in higher concentration 
(Ciani et al., 2010 ; Jolly et al., 2014 ; Varela, 2016 ). 
Various volatile compounds of different classes have been found in 
ciders; some of these are derived from the fruit (Dixon and Hewett, 
2001 ) but most of them are formed during oxidative and alcoholic 
fermentation as secondary metabolites. The volatile compounds pro-
duced during fermentation belong to alcohols, esters, aldehydes, organic 
acids, etc., and mainly define the cider aroma (Eleut ˘erio dos Santos 
et al., 2015 ). 
Yeasts are the main responsible for alcoholic fermentation and 
therefore confer the characteristic flavor to the beverages (Beech and 
Davenport, 1970 ; Cabranes et al., 1997 ; Su˘arez Valles et al., 2005 ). 
There are few available studies about microbial population dynamics in

2spontaneous cider fermentations, however, it is mentioned that the 
composition of yeasts populations can vary according to climatic con-
ditions, apple varieties, geographical location and manufacturing tech-
nology used (Cabranes et al., 1990 ; Del Campo et al., 2003 ; Su˘arez Valles 
et al., 2007 ). In general, at the beginning of the fermentation, native 
non-Saccharomyces yeasts with a low fermentation capacity predomi -
nate (Coton et al., 2006 ; Morrissey et al., 2004 ; Su˘arez Valles et al., 
2007 ). Yeasts with a greater tolerance to ethanol, such as those of the 
genus Saccharomyces complete the fermentation. 
In Irish cider, many different indigenous yeast species have been 
identified, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Hanseniaspora uvarum , 
Brettanomyces bruxellensis , B. anomalus , Debaromyces polymorphus , Pichia 
fermentans , P. guillermondii , P. anomala (Wickerhamomyces anomalus ), 
and others (Morrissey et al., 2004 ). Meanwhile, in French cider the 
predominant yeasts corresponded to Saccharomyces bayanus , 
S. cerevisiae , Lachancea cidri, Dekkera anomala (W. anomalus ), Candida 
sake, C. tropicalis and K. marxianus (Coton et al., 2006 ). 
Liu et al. (2016) evaluated the impact of co-fermentation with 
S. cerevisiae and Williopsis saturnus on the volatile profile of cider, which 
resulted in a more complex volatile profile, potentially influencing the 
aromatic characteristics of cider. Wei et al. (2019, 2020) evaluated 
different non-Saccharomyces species for apple juice fermentation (in 
pure or co-fermentations), with interesting results mainly in the volatile 
profile. 
In previous studies on wine and beer (Montanari et al., 2009 ; Pal-
ukurty et al., 2008 ; Walker, 2004 ; Zhao and Bai, 2012 ), it has been 
determined that cations, such as magnesium, manganese, zinc and 
others, are necessary to optimize yeasts performance during alcoholic 
fermentation. These compounds acted as cofactors in several metabolic 
pathways such as glucose uptake, regulation of the cellular cycle and 
others. One of the most important cations that influence the cellular 
development of yeasts is zinc, because it acts as a cofactor in several 
metabolic pathways and acts by activating the kinases. Finally, mag-
nesium is considered another essential cofactor for a good development 
of glycolysis. These cations are usually found in sufficient concentrations 
in the apple juice; however, it is possible that their addition to the must 
increases conversion rate of sugars into ethanol. 
The observation that non-Saccharomyces populations do not persist 
until the end of the fermentations can be explained by two main reasons: 
the low ethanol resistance and/or, depletion of nutrients essential for 
their development. The aims of the present work were to isolate, identify 
and preserve the yeasts present in spontaneous cider fermentations and 
to characterize their ability to carry out alone the alcoholic fermentation 
of apple juice in absence or with the addition of magnesium, zinc and 
nitrogen, at specific concentrations and to evaluate its impact on ethanol 
production and volatile compounds generation. Despite the growing 
interest in this drink, this study is the first to determine the role of 
nutrient addition in the fermentation of apple juice with non-Saccha -
romyces yeasts. 
2.Materials and methods 
2.1. Obtention of apple juice from the cider processes 
Apple juice was obtained from apples called “rayada criolla ” from 
the Hidalgo mountains, perhaps derived from red delicious variety 
(D˘avila-Gauna, 2007 ; Fern˘andez et al., 2010 ). A clarified apple juice was 
obtained after different processes (wash, extraction, filtration) from an 
artisanal cider factory in the state of Hidalgo, Mexico, before fermen -
tation. The juice was collected, sterile filtered at 0.22 μm and frozen at 
 20 •C until use. 
2.2. Isolation of wild yeasts 
Several samples of apple juice were collected from different 
fermentation tanks at the beginning of the fermentation prior to commercial yeast addition. Pre-sterilized glass jars were used for taking 
the sample in each tank. For the isolation of autochthonous yeasts a 
series of cultures were made by ten-fold serial dilutions using WL 
Nutrient chloramphenicol agar medium (Fluka). The inoculated petri 
dishes were incubated at room temperature (29 •C–31 •C) and the 
morphological differences were best observed in the WL medium after 
48 h of incubation. Between 1 and 10 colonies for each morphology were 
isolated and subjected to PCR-RFLP. YPD agar medium (yeast extract, 
peptone, dextrose and agar) was used to maintain and growth the iso-
lated yeast. 
2.3. Preservation of autochthonous yeasts from cider fermentation 
The isolated yeasts were transferred to YPD broth for the develop -
ment of biomass and once in exponential phase were harvested and 
preserved in 50% glycerol at  80 •C. 
2.4. Yeasts identification 
Biomass from each isolated colony was directly subjected to PCR 
reactions Ten colonies of each yeast morphology were harvested and 
suspended in a PCR reaction mixture. For amplification of the ITS-5.8S 
rRNA region, the primers ITS1 (5∕-TCC GTA GGT AA CCT GCG-3∕) and 
ITS4 (5∕-TCC TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC-3∕) were used. PCR conditions 
described by Esteve-Zarzoso et al. (1999) were followed and the enzy-
matic digestions were carried out using restriction enzymes HhaI, HaeIII 
and HinfI. Restriction fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis in 3% 
(w/v) agarose gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) conducted at 100 V 
for 1 h in TAE 1×buffer (Sigma –Aldrich). The gels were stained with 
ethidium bromide (Sigma –Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), visualized 
under UV light using a GelDoc XR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), 
the size of the fragments was estimated by comparison with TrackIt 100 
bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen), and analyzed using the Quantity One 
software (Bio-Rad). 
After grouping the isolates based on the RFLP patterns, a represen -
tative of each group was selected for further analysis. 
The identity of the yeasts was confirmed by amplifying and 
sequencing the variable domain D1/D2 of the large (26S) ribosomal 
RNA subunit (Kurtzman and Robnett, 1998 ). The PCR products were 
sequenced by Macrogen USA Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). The consensus 
sequences were obtained with CLC Main Workbench 5.5 and were 
aligned in GenBank using the BLASTn algorithm. 
2.5. Cider fermentation using isolated yeasts independently 
The isolated yeasts were grown independently in YPD broth at 30 •C 
under shaking at 250 rpm, at the end of the exponential growth the 
yeasts were centrifuged and washed twice with sterile 0.9% NaCl solu-
tion and subsequently inoculated at a final concentration of 1.0 ×107 
cells/mL in the apple juice adjusted to 16•Bx. 
The fermentation was carried out using 950 mL of apple juice at 
20 •C (±2 •C) and 100 rpm. During the fermentation, samples were 
taken every 24 h to evaluate cell growth, sugar consumption, concen -
tration of organic acids, and the production of ethanol and major vola-
tile compounds such as higher alcohols, methanol, esters and aldehydes. 
All fermentations were performed in triplicate. 
2.6. Factorial design for nutrients during cider fermentation 
Nutritional requirements for cider production were evaluated in 
batch fermentations for each yeast species and were performed in 950 
mL of apple juice an initial sugar concentration of 160 g/L at pH 4.5. A 
full factorial experiment design 23 with a center point was carried out. 
The three factors were the nutrients: zinc (10 to 20 mg/L as zinc sulfate), 
magnesium (100 to 400 mg/L as magnesium sulfate) and nitrogen (1 to 
3 g/L as ammonium phosphate) and the response variables were the A. Gschaedler et al.

(Table 1). 
Additionally, a complete nutrient mixture (experiment M) was used 
as a control for the yeasts (Tibayrenc et al., 2010 ; S˘anchez et al., 2013 ) 
which composition was (g/L): KH2PO4, 3.0; (NH 4)2SO4, 3.0; Na2H-
PO4⋅12H 2O, 3.0; glutamate, 1.0; glucose, 20.0; MgSO 4⋅7H2O, 0.5; 
ZnSO 4⋅7H2O, 0.04; MnSO 4⋅H2O, 0.0038; CoCl 2⋅6H2O, 0.0005; 
CuSO 4⋅5H2O, 0.0009; Na2MoSO 4⋅2H2O, 0.00006; CaCl 2⋅2H2O, 0.023; 
(NH 4) 2Fe(SO 4)2⋅6H2O, 0.023; H3BO3, 0.003; pantothenic acid, 0.005; 
nicotinic acid, 0.005; inositol, 0.125; thiamine, 0.005; pyridoxine, 
0.005; p-aminobenzoic acid, 0.001; and biotin, 0.000012. The fermen -
tations started by inoculating 1.0 ×107 cells/mL and incubating the 
culture at 20 •C and 100 rpm. Samples were taken every 12 h for a 120 h. 
All the experiments were performed in triplicate for statistical 
evaluation. 
2.7. Analytical determinations 
2.7.1. Biomass measurements 
Yeast populations were monitored during all fermentations using a 
Neubauer counting chamber and biomass was determined at the 
beginning and at the end of the fermentation by measuring cell dry 
weight (DW). 
2.7.2. Ethanol and volatile compounds quantification 
The ethanol and volatile compounds concentrations were deter -
mined using a gas chromatograph (HP 7890-B, USA) with a flame 
ionization detector (FID) at 250 •C, coupled with a head-space system 
(HP 7694E, USA). The separation column was a poliethilenglycol HP 
innowax (60 m ×0.32 mm ×0.25 μm). The oven conditions were: 55 •C 
for 5 min, increasing 5 •C/min up to 160 •C, then, an increment of 25 •C/ 
min until a final temperature of 220 •C was attained and sustained for 8 
min (Alcazar-Valle et al., 2019 ). 
The 2 mL sample was placed in a 20 mL vial for analysis in a head-
space system. The vial, loop and transfer line temperatures were 80 •C, 
110 •C and 115 •C respectively. In addition, the time set to reach the vial 
equilibrium was 5 min, the pressurization time was 0.2 min, the loop fill, 
equilibrium times were set at 0.2 and 0.5 min respectively, and the in-
jection time was 1 min. The quantification of volatile compounds was 
performed using commercial standards (Sigma Aldrich) as: iso-
butyraldehyde, ethyl acetate, methanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, amyl 
alcohols, isobutanol, ethyl valerate, ethyl lactate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl 
caproate, 2-furfuraldehyde, and 2-phenyl ethanol. Quantification was 
performed according to the external standard method. 
2.7.3. Sugars and organic acids quantification 
The sugars consumed and organic acids produced were determined 
by HPLC using an aminex HPX-87C column 300 mm ×7.8 mm biorad. 
The supernatant was first filtered using Teflon filters at 0.45 mm. The injection volume was 20 μL, the mobile phase was deionized water, the 
flow rate was 0.5 mL/min, and a refractive index was used as a detector. 
2.7.4. Zinc and magnesium quantification 
The zinc and magnesium in the apple juice were determined using 
inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry following the 
methodology of EPA 6010B (ICP). Magnesium and zinc were analyzed 
using a VARIAN 240FS Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (air/ 
acetylene) equipped with an automatic sample dispensing system SPIS- 
20. The absorbance of Mg2ions was determined at a wavelength of 
202.6 nm and Zn2at 213.9 nm. 
2.7.5. Yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) quantification 
YAN was quantified with the Ammonia Assay Kit (Rapid) (Wicklow, 
Ireland) following the manufacturer ’s instructions. 
2.7.6. Statistical analysis 
The effect of the nutrients was analyzed using ANOVA, with the 
Statgraphics Centurion XV software. Differences in ethanol, organic 
acids and volatile compounds concentrations were assessed by analysis 
of variance (Tukey ’s test). Differences were considered significant if the 
P-values obtained were below 0.05. A heatmap of volatile compounds 
was used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to show the better 
differentiation between yeasts and nutritional compounds. 
3.Results and discussion 
3.1. Identification and use of autochthonous cider yeasts 
In order to isolate the autochthonous yeasts present in the apple 
juice, sampling was carried out at the beginning of the spontaneous 
fermentation, since non-Saccharomyces yeasts predominate at this 
moment in wine and cider (Varela, 2016 ; Pando-Bedri ~nana et al., 2010 ). 
A series of cultures were made by ten-fold serial dilutions in WL 
chloramphenicol medium. The yeasts were best differentiated based on 
their colony morphology observed in the WL medium and subsequently 
up to 10 colonies were taken randomly to group and identify the isolates 
based on RFLP patterns. The dominant wild yeast was Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae (ScCid1), but also Kluyveromyces marxianus (KmCid1), Pichia 
kluyveri (PkCid1), Pichia membranaefaciens (PmCid1) and Zygosacchar -
omyces rouxii (ZrCid1) were identified (Table 2). A representative isolate 
of each yeast species was considered for the next experiments. Only 
S. cerevisiae has been used for the cider production at industrial level, but 
the non-Saccharomyces have not been thoroughly studied, moreover 
Z. rouxii is considered as spoilage yeasts in apple juice (Wang et al., 
2016 ). P. kluyveri has been evaluated in co-culture with Torulaspora 
delbrueckii , achieving a complete alcoholic fermentation with more 
complex aromas (Lu et al., 2017 ). Also, there is a patent to produce cider 
using P. kluyveri , because it produces higher levels of hexyl acetate and 
other volatile compounds, however, the ethanol production was less 
than 0.2% v/v, producing a cider with low ethanol level. In addition, 
when P. kluyveri was used in co-culture with T. delbrueckii and 
K. thermotolerans , a cider with high hexyl acetate was produced (Saerens 
and Swiegers, 2015 ). Wei et al. (2019) used different non-Saccharomyces 
to ferment different fruit juices. One of the best results was a Fuji apple 
juice fermentation with a species of P. kluyveri (pure culture), mainly 
due to the interesting volatile profile obtained, particularly with tropical 
fruit aroma notes. However, the initial concentration of sugars from this 
fermentation is relatively low and consumption is not completed at the 
end of the fermentation. In another study, Wei et al. (2020) analyzed the 
chemical composition and sensorial properties of ciders fermented with 
different non-Saccharomyces yeasts in pure and mixed fermentations. 
The yeasts tested were P. kluyveri , Hanseniaspora vineae , H. uvarum and 
T. quercuum . As in the previous work, the volatile profiles obtained were 
interesting and varied greatly depending on the yeast species and their 
combinations, but in many cases, the ethanol concentration produced Table 1 
Factorial design 23 for nutrients during cider fermentation. Center point (exp 9), 
a fermentation without adding nutrients as control (C) and a fermentation with 
nutrients as a positive control (M, mixture of vitamins, nutrients, and glutamic 
acid) were used.

4was low. These works demonstrate that these yeast species can be used 
for the cider production. Nevertheless, it is important evaluate if these 
yeasts could be used as an inoculum for cider production, considering 
the volatile compounds and ethanol concentrations obtained and which 
nutrients and their concentrations are necessary to ensure the obtention 
of a cider with a suitable profile. 
3.2. Lab-scale cider fermentations with isolated yeasts 
In order to determine the fermentative capacities of the selected 
yeast species isolated from the cider production process, we carried out 
individual fermentations using independently each yeast species. The 
fermentation results are shown in Fig. 1 and the kinetic parameters are shown in Table 3. In the case of S. cerevisiae the sugars were consumed 
almost completely in 175 h, while at 200 h the maximum concentration 
of ethanol was observed (88 g/L). In the case of K. marxianus , P. kluyveri 
and Z. rouxii , after 300 h, not all the sugars present in the apple juice 
were assimilated, also the ethanol production was lower (29 g/L; 48 g/L 
and 48 g/L, respectively). P. membranaefaciens required more than 100 h 
to start sugar consumption and initiate cell growth. These yeast species 
may not be able to consume or utilize nutrients directly, or it is even 
possible that the initial concentration of sugars caused an inhibition in 
the yeast cells. However, 90% of sugars were consumed after 300 h of 
fermentation producing 57 g/L of ethanol, but the ethanol yield was 
only 0.39. It is necessary to increase the ethanol production to produce a 
beverage considered cider (F3.5% Vol. Alc.). Furthermore, the amount Table 2

5of some nutrients in the apple juice may not have been enough or be 
easily consumed by the non-Saccharomyces yeasts and so they could not 
finish the fermentation. Nutrients as nitrogen, zinc and magnesium, 
have been identified as essential for the yeasts (García et al., 2016 ; Prior 
et al., 2019 ; Varela, 2016 ; Walker and Walker, 2018 ). In addition, there 
are many reports that mention the low ethanol tolerance of non- Saccharomyces yeasts, which limits their application at industrial level 
(Fu et al., 2019 ; Gschaedler, 2017 ; Li et al., 2018 ; Mateo and Maicas, 
2016 ). 
Interestingly, the cell growth of non-Saccharomyces yeast species was 
not impaired by the fermentation medium, reaching populations higher 
than 6.5 ×107 cells/mL, however, cell growth did not seem to be the Table 3

6main factor to assure a complete fermentation. Hence, it was necessary 
to add nutrients in order to accomplish total sugar consumption, high 
ethanol production and generation of desired volatile compounds 
(Amaya-Delgado et al., 2013 ; Mendoza et al., 2009 ). 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed the highest specific growth rate 
(μmax), indicating an easy adaptation to the apple juice and adequate 
quantities and diversity of nutrients to achieve the fermentation. The 
sugar consumption rate (rS) and ethanol production rate (rP) were low in 
K. marxianus , and P. kluyveri , but as mentioned, these species required 
long adaptation phases (Table 3). Some works reported the influence of 
non-Saccharomyces yeasts during mixed fermentation with S. cerevisiae 
(Dierings et al., 2013 ), and mentioned that ethanol toxicity and nutri-
ents competition are the main situation for the low growth and 
fermentation ability of non-Saccharomyces yeasts (Wei et al., 2020 ). 
However, in the present work, fermentations were carried out by using 
non-Saccharomyces yeast species as unique yeast (without S. cerevisiae ) 
observing that non-Saccharomyces yeasts were not able to finish the 
fermentation alone. That means, not only the ethanol and nutrients 
competition decrease the ethanol production by non-Saccharomyces but 
also probably more nutrients or different fermentation conditions are 
needed to finish the fermentation. 
3.3. Nutrients evaluation for lab-scale cider fermentation 
For many non-Saccharomyces yeasts, isolated from different 
fermentative processes, it has been stated that they do not show high 
fermentation capacities and are not able to carry out fermentations at 
industrial level, probably due to certain nutrient limitations. First, the 
apple juice used for the fermentations was evaluated for its mineral 
composition, containing 42.23 mg/L of magnesium and 0.28 mg/L of 
zinc. Also, yeast assimilable nitrogen was quantified as 73.12 mg/L. 
These results showed similar concentrations to other apple juices 
mentioned in other studies (Tarko et al., 2020 ; Boudreau et al., 2017 ). 
Nitrogen, magnesium and zinc, also vitamins and other essential 
nutrients, were evaluated using a factorial design to determine their 
effect on the fermentation capabilities of the yeasts. In Fig. 2, the final 
ethanol concentrations achieved in each fermentation are shown. 
S. cerevisiae produced almost the same amount of ethanol independently 
of the nutrients added. K. marxianus , Z. rouxii and P. kluyveri , showed an 
increase of ethanol production when nutrients were added, even at the 
lowest concentrations tested. In the experiments M, where vitamins and 
other nutrients reported as necessary for the yeasts growth (S˘anchez 
et al., 2013 ; Tibayrenc et al., 2010 ) were added, no yeast did show a 
higher ethanol production indicating that they were not essential. The 
concentration of each nutrient (Zn, Mg and N) influences each yeast 
species in a different way. K. marxianus increased the ethanol production 
in all the experiments almost at the same level, without any statistical 
difference. In Fig. 2, ethanol production was not increased at higher 
concentrations of nitrogen in P. membranaefaciens (PM 2), observing 
non-statistical difference compared to the control (PM C). To obtain the 
maximum ethanol production it was necessary to add 1 g/L of nitrogen, 
400 mg/L of magnesium and 20 mg/L of zinc (PM 7). P. kluyveri required 
the middle concentration of each compound to increase the ethanol 
concentration (N, 2 g/L; Mg, 250 mg/L and Zn, 15 mg/L; PK 9). Finally, 
Z. rouxii showed different effects, but at higher levels of nutrients (ZR8) 
and in the middle point produced the highest ethanol concentration 
(ZR9) exhibited that the compounds addition was essential to guarantee 
its fermentation performance. Yeasts are exposed during fermentation to 
different stresses, such as osmotic stress, ethanol stress, and even 
nutrient limitations, causing changes in physiological characteristics 
and fermentation performance (Roca-Mesa et al., 2020 ; Walker and 
Basso, 2019 ). Non-Saccharomyces yeasts have been considered during a 
long time as spoilage yeasts, but in the last years that definition has been 
reconsidered because most of them possess unique enzymes which 
potentially give rise to desired sensorial characteristics in wine (Jolly 
et al., 2006 ). Also, low ethanol production by non-Saccharomyces yeasts is considered to be related to its toxicity (Jolly et al., 2014 ). The results 
obtained in this work show that the yeast species were the main factor 
impacting on ethanol production, probably due to the difference be-
tween their regulatory pathways for the assimilation of different nutri-
ents. Fermentations performed without their addition implied that non- 
Saccharomyces yeasts only partially assimilated sugars and produced low 
ethanol levels. It is well known that adequate levels of a nitrogen source, 
such as ammonium ions, in the fermentation musts enhance efficient 
growth of yeast cells and desirable fermentation performance (Lei et al., 
2012 ). The nitrogen source present in apple juice are amino acids, 
however, their concentration is not enough for most yeasts (Blateyron 
and Sablayrolles, 2001 ; Liu et al., 2016 ; Prior et al., 2019 ). 
Zinc has been proven to be an essential ion for the activity of the 
enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (Magonet et al., 1992 ), because it 
participates in the conversion of acetaldehyde into ethanol during 
fermentation, stimulates the activity of pyruvate decarboxylase in 
S. cerevisiae and participates in the Zn/Mg superoxide dismutase activ-
ity. Low zinc concentrations (D1 mg/L) during fermentation may cause 
slow and incomplete fermentations (Jacobsen et al., 1982 ). But there is 
no correlation between zinc concentration and cell growth, therefore, 
zinc increases the specific fermentation rate of each cell (Bromberg 
et al., 1997 ). 
Magnesium is another ionic cofactor necessary for many enzymes 
during the glycolysis and other important metabolic pathways (Brom -
berg et al., 1997 ; Walker et al., 1996 ). Magnesium supplementation of 
the apple juice increased the ethanol production in all non-Saccharo -
myces yeasts fermentations. The experiment 9 was the center point 
adding 250 mg/L of magnesium, which was enough to achieve almost 
80 g/L of ethanol. 
3.4. Volatile compounds production 
One of the reasons for using non-Saccharomyces yeasts is that they 
generally produce higher concentrations and/or diversity of volatile 
compounds. Using a factorial design, the main volatile compounds were 
evaluated at the end of the fermentation. The results obtained are shown 
in Fig. 3 and are represented in a heat map where the white color 
correspond to a low-level production (Min) and black to higher con-
centrations (Max), both low and high level are mentioned in the Fig. 3 as 
a column. Fifteen compounds, including different esters, higher alcohols 
and aldehydes, were evaluated. With S. cerevisiae only nine volatile 
compounds were produced in high concentrations, whereas isoamyl 
acetate, 2-phenyl acetate and medium-chain esters were not detected. 
P. membranaefaciens was the only yeast that produced all volatile com-
pounds evaluated, but some of them in low concentrations. However, 
the detection threshold of the esters is high, that means that low con-
centrations may have a huge impact on the sensorial characteristics of a 
beverage. The addition of Mg, N and Zn changed the volatile compound 
profiles produced in all yeast species; this determines the need to know 
the adequate concentrations of nutrients during fermentation for the 
production of alcoholic beverages (Prior et al., 2019 ; Tarko et al., 2020 ). 
Z. rouxii , produced the highest level of ethyl acetate, almost 1 g/L, and 
P. kluyveri and K. marxianus produced 6 and 4 times more than 
S. cerevisiae , showing the importance of the non-Saccharomyces yeasts 
for the ethyl esters production in alcoholic beverages (Canonico et al., 
2019 ). The control experiments (C, Fig. 3), without the addition of any 
nutrient, showed the lowest volatile compound concentrations for 
S. cerevisiae , P. membranaefaciens , Z. rouxii and P. kluyveri . On the con-
trary, K. marxianus was the only yeast that produced more volatile 
compound in this condition. These results allow the establishment of 
conditions that favor or disfavor the growth and fermentation of certain 
species and orient the production of certain volatile compounds that 
would contribute to obtain differentiated products, with different 
organoleptic profiles. 
The nitrogen added to the apple juice did not increase the production 
of higher alcohols, esters and aldehydes (Fig. 3, experiments 2, 4, 6 and A. Gschaedler et al.

88), which shows that these yeasts did not require high nitrogen con-
centrations. In experiment 1, with the lowest levels of nutrients added 
(N, 1 g/L; Mg, 200 mg/L and Zn 10 mg/L), P. membranaefaciens (PM 1) 
showed the highest production of volatile compounds such as iso-
butyraldehyde, isobutanol, isoamyl acetate, butanol, ethyl hexanoate 
and ethyl octanoate. Z. rouxii (ZR 1) produced also higher concentra -
tions of isobutyraldehyde, isobutanol, isoamyl acetate, isoamyl alcohol 
and furfuryl alcohol. It is well known that yeasts adapt to the conditions 
of the culture medium collectively, increasing the production of volatile 
compounds such as aromatic alcohols and esters, this process is known 
as quorum-sensing (Zupan et al., 2013 ). However, the mechanisms of 
action and how communication occurs between the different organisms 
present are still not well understood. Probably low nutrients concen -
trations promote the volatile compound production as a quorum-sensing 
signal and guarantees the conservation of the species (Brex˘o and De 
Souza Sant ’Ana, 2018 ). However, in the experiment 1 with low nutrients 
concentrations, ethanol was not produced at a high level. P. kluyveri 
produced high level of volatile compounds in PK 9, which has the middle 
point of the nutrients (N, 2 g/L; Mg, 250 mg/L and Zn, 15 mg/L) and 
when compared to the control experiment (Fig. 3, Experiment C), the 
lowest concentration was obtained. For some yeasts used in this work, 
an addition of adequate concentrations of nutrients was necessary, in 
order to assure their fermentation performance and a balance between 
nitrogen, zinc and magnesium was fundamental for each yeast species 
tested. On the other hand, in experiments M (where a mixture of vita-
mins, trace elements and glutamic acid was added) no improvement in 
fermentation was observed. These results show that non-Saccharomyces 
yeast species do not need this type of compounds to improve their 
fermentation capabilities. 
The nutrients important for volatile compounds production have 
been investigated before, however, most of the works have been con-
ducted using S. cerevisiae as a yeast model, and the results suggest clear 
differences between yeast species due to their nutrient requirements 
(Walker and Walker, 2018 ). It is known that nitrogen limitation, 
strongly promotes the aromatic alcohols production in Torulaspora del-
brueckii , Metschnikowia pulcherrima and Starmerella bacillaris , while low 
glucose concentrations have the opposite effect (Gonz ˘alez et al., 2018 ). 
In this work, all non-Saccharomyces increased higher alcohols produc -
tion after nitrogen addition, except K. marxianus , which produced them 
in higher concentration when no nutrients were added. 
Magnesium and zinc are two important nutrients for yeast fermen -
tation in general; however, they have not been studied in the case of 
cider fermentations with non-Saccharomyces yeasts. Guti˘errez et al. 
(2018) , produced cider, wine and beer using ninety-nine non-Saccha -
romyces yeast strains, and glucose worth (mix of nutrients), grapes juice 
and apple juice were used on the fermentations, but without the addition 
of any nutritional compound. However, the results showed few differ -
ences in volatile compounds production between glucose worth and 
juices. The most important factor was the yeast strain, even if nitrogen is 
added as amino acids at 1.5 g/L, magnesium 100 mg/L and zinc 0.4 mg/ 
L using glucose worth, grapes juice and apple juice. Similar results were 
obtained in our work, because the yeast species isolated from the cider 
production process was the most important factor for volatile com-
pounds production. The highest volatile concentration was not obtained 
at high magnesium concentrations, neither at high zinc concentration; 
most of the non-Saccharomyces yeasts employed in this study produced 
more volatile compounds at mid-level concentration (center point), but 
it is still necessary to evaluate the sensory profile. 
4.Conclusion 
In conclusion, the addition of nitrogen, magnesium and zinc depends 
on the yeast species and has a direct impact on the fermentation per-
formance. This work highlighted the importance of knowing and con-
trolling the nutrients concentration to guarantee not only the complete 
development of the fermentation and avoid problems such as sluggish or stuck fermentations, but also the presence of volatile compounds in the 
desired concentrations. Likewise, it was shown that it is possible to use 
non-Saccharomyces yeasts as unique yeast in fermentation, achieving the 
desired levels of ethanol as long as adequate concentrations of nitrogen, 
magnesium and zinc are added. Finally, the nutritional needs of non- 
Saccharomyces yeasts are greater than S. cerevisiae , so it is necessary to 
know the basic requirements of each yeast which will be employed in 
cider production. Besides, it is necessary to scale-up the process to 
produce cider at industrial level and to conduct sensory evaluations in 
order to select an autochthonous non-Saccharomyces yeast for the pro-
duction of a high-quality cider.
