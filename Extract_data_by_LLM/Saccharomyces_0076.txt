Techno-economic analysis ABSTRACT  
This study presents a cost-effective strategy for producing organic acids from glucose and xylose using the acid- 
tolerant yeast, Issatchenkia orientalis. I. orientalis was engineered to produce lactic acid from xylose, and the 
resulting strain, SD108XL, successfully converted sorghum hydrolysates into lactic acid. In order to enable low- 
pH fermentation, a self-buffering strategy, where the lactic acid generated by the SD108XL strain during 
fermentation served as a buffer, was developed. As a result, the SD108 strain produced 67 g/L of lactic acid from 
73 g/L of glucose and 40 g/L of xylose, simulating a sugar composition of sorghum biomass hydrolysates. 
Moreover, techno-economic analysis underscored the efficiency of the self-buffering strategy in streamlining the 
downstream process, thereby reducing production costs. These results demonstrate the potential of I. orientalis as 
a platform strain for the cost-effective production of organic acids from cellulosic hydrolysates.

21.Introduction 
Rapid industrialization based on petrochemical processes has led to 
significant environmental challenges, such as climate change, due to the 
emission of flue gases, including CO2, CH4, and CO (Delangiz et al., 
2019). Thanks to the significant developments in biotechnology, mi-
crobial bioprocesses have emerged as a sustainable option for 
manufacturing various industrial products (Paul et al., 2019; Volk et al., 
2023). The Department of Energy (DOE) has identified promising bio-
based chemicals, encompassing a variety of organic acids, such as suc-
cinic, fumaric, malic, glucaric, aspartic, glutamic, and levulinic acids 
(Choi et al., 2015). Metabolic engineering of microorganisms facilitates 
the production of these organic acids, contributing to a more environ -
mentally sustainable production process (Chen & Nielsen, 2016; Tran 
et al., 2023; Tran & Zhao, 2021). Moreover, the growing interest in 
biodegradable plastics has further emphasized the importance of bio- 
based production of monomeric organic acids as building blocks 
(Liang et al., 2022; Mazzoli, 2020). 
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has also under -
scored the significance of lignocellulosic biorefineries in promoting 
sustainable industries (Davis et al., 2018). Lignocellulosic biomass, 
which consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, provides abundant 
carbon sources for microbial fermentation. Notably, hemicellulose and 
cellulose yield pentose and hexose sugars through the hydrolysis of 
lignocellulosic biomass (Magalhaes et al., 2019). In order to optimize 
the use of lignocellulosic biomass in bioprocess, numerous studies have 
aimed to enable microorganisms to metabolize compounds such as 
xylose, acetate, and cellobiose (Kwak et al., 2019). Specifically, exten -
sive research on yeast engineering has been conducted for the biological 
conversion of xylose, the second most abundant sugar, and other carbon 
sources in lignocellulosic biomass (Kwak et al., 2019). As such, yeast 
strains have emerged as promising candidates for the industrial pro-
duction of bioproducts derived from lignocellulosic biomass. 
Several studies have reported the bioconversion of lignocellulosic 
biomass into organic acids using engineered yeasts (Kwak et al., 2019). 
However, the economic feasibility of the overall bioprocess remains 
uncertain. During yeast fermentation for organic acid production, which 
leads to acidic conditions, a neutralization step is necessary to maintain 
an optimal pH level for yeast growth (Mitsui et al., 2020; Watcharawipas et al., 2021; Xi et al., 2023). This neutralization process dissociates the 
organic acid into its less soluble salt form, necessitating an additional 
acidification step to obtain the undissociated acid. This step, however, 
generates gypsum as a byproduct, which demands further downstream 
processing for its removal. These downstream processes contribute to 
increased energy consumption and costs. If low-pH fermentation is 
feasible, the neutralization step could be eliminated, allowing for the 
removal of subsequent downstream processes, such as acidification and 
gypsum purification. This approach is anticipated to reduce energy 
consumption and the overall cost of microbial organic acid production 
(Marchesan et al., 2021; Tran et al., 2023). Additionally, low pH 
fermentation may help minimize the risk of contamination because 
neutral pH conditions are typically optimal for microorganisms (Xi et al., 
2023). 
The yeast strain Issatchenkia orientalis, also referred to as Pichia 
kudriavzevii, Candida glycerinogenes, and Candida krusei, exhibits high 
tolerance to unfavorable conditions for microbial growth (e.g., high 
temperatures or low pH levels) and inhibitors in lignocellulosic hydro -
lysates (e.g., furan derivatives) (Douglass et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2022). 
Indeed, I. orientalis showed improved cell growth and ethanol produc -
tion when subjected to high temperatures, acidic environments, and 
furfural derivatives as compared to well-known yeast strains such as 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Seong et al., 2017). Thus, low-pH fermentation 
using lignocellulosic hydrolysates appears to be feasible with 
I. orientalis. 
In this study, an efficient bioprocess to produce lactic acid from 
glucose and xylose using I. orientalis was developed. Through metabolic 
engineering, I. orientalis was enabled to consume xylose and produce 
lactic acid. Lactic acid was successfully produced from sorghum hy-
drolysates containing glucose and xylose. An innovative self-buffering 
strategy for a low-pH fermentation approach was also devised to 
reduce the use of neutralizing agents and simplify the downstream 
process when producing organic acids. As such, a cost-effective bio-
process for organic acid production using glucose and xylose was suc-
cessfully developed with I. orientalis. Table 1

32.Materials and methods 
2.1. Strain construction 
All strains and plasmids used in this study were described in Table 1. 
I. orientalis strains were maintained and grown on YP medium (10 g/L of 
yeast extract and 20 g/L of peptone) containing 20 g/L of glucose at 
30 •C, and 120 μg/L of nourseothricin (cloNAT) was supplemented as a 
selection marker when required. Escherichia coli TOP 10 (Invitrogen, 
USA) was used for cloning. E. coli transformants were grown on Luria- 
Bertani (LB) medium (5 g/L of yeast extract, 10 g/L of tryptone, and 
10 g/L of sodium chloride) at 37 •C with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. 
2.2. Yeast strain construction 
All transformation methods used in this study were based on the 
previous lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene 
glycol method using a CRISPR/Cas9 system with some modifications 
(Lee et al., 2022 ). Heat-shock treatment for I. orientalis was maintained 
at 42 •C for 90 min, and the heat-shocked cells were recovered in YP 
medium for 4 h before plating the cells on YPD agar plates with 120 μg/ 
mL of nourseothricin (cloNAT). In order to construct the Cas9-based 
genome-edited strains, the pCast plasmid containing Cas9 and guide 
RNA expression cassettes were used (Lee et al., 2022 ). For PDC deletion, 
plasmid pVT36b-PDC was transformed into strain SD108/ura3 Δ. For 
verification of deletion, the PDC gene was PCR-amplified using primers 
PDC.check.F and PDC.check.R from genomic DNA, and the PCR product 
was digested with EcoRI. Successful deletion of PDC resulted in 2 bands 
on the agarose gel. Plasmid pVT36b-PDC was then cured using SC-FOA, 
resulting in strain SD108/pdc Δ/ura3 Δ. For GPD deletion, plasmid 
pVT36b-GPD was transformed into strain SD108/pdc Δ/ura3 Δ. For 
verification of deletion, the GPD gene was PCR-amplified using primers 
GPD.check.F and GPD.check.R from genomic DNA, and the PCR product 
was digested with EcoRI. Successful deletion of GPD resulted in 2 bands 
on the agarose gel. Plasmid pVT36b-GPD was then cured using SC-FOA, 
resulting in strain SD108/pdc Δ/gpd Δ/ura3 Δ. For the integration of D- 
lactate dehydrogenase gene from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (LmLDH ) 
(Cao et al., 2020b ), the LDH cassette was PCR-amplified from plasmid 
pScARS/CEN-L-LDH using primers LDH.F and LDH.R and co- 
transformed with pVT36b-int1 into SD108/pdc Δ/gpd Δ/ura3 Δ. Yeast 
colonies were screened for integration of the LDH cassette by PCR using 
primers LDH.check.F and int1.down.R. Plasmid pVT36b-int1 was then 
cured using SC-FOA, leading to strain SD108/pdc Δ/gpd Δ/LDH/ura3 Δ 
(SD108L). For introducing xylose-fermenting pathway, the expression 
cassette including xylose reductase (XR), xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH), 
and xylulose kinase (XK) from Scheffersomyces stipitis was generated by 
PCR amplification using plasmid pIO-UG_X123 with primers of 
F_repair_IS2_X123 and R_repair_IS2_X123 (Table 1). The resulting 
amplicon was used as donor DNA and integrated into the previously 
identified intergenic sites of chromosome 2 (named IS2) (Lee et al., 
2022 ). The amplified DNA fragments and Cas9-gRNA plasmids (pCas -
t_IS2) were co-transformed into the SD108L strain. Correct integration 
of the XR, XDH, and XK expression cassette in the IS2 region was 
confirmed by PCR amplification with F_check_IS2 and R_check_IS2 
primers. 
2.3. Shake-flask fermentations 
For shake-flask fermentations, I. orientalis strains were cultured in a 
125-mL shake-flask with 25 mL of medium. The cultures were per-
formed at 30 •C and 100 rpm for microaerobic conditions. When 
neutralization was required, 50 g/L of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) was 
used as a neutralizing agent. Optical density at 600 nm (OD 600) was 
measured using 0.2 M HCl to dilute culture instead of deionized water to 
prevent interference by residual CaCO 3. In shake-flask fermentations, 
various fermentations were conducted using YP and synthetic complete (SC) medium (6.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base and 0.79 g/L complete sup-
plement mixture (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA)) containing glucose 
and xylose, as well as sorghum biomass hydrolysate. 
2.4. Bioreactor fermentations 
Bioreactor fermentations were conducted in a DASbox mini biore -
actor system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The culture volume of 
each bioreactor was 100 mL. Glucose and xylose were added to YP 
medium to mimic the sugar concentrations of lignocellulosic biomass 
hydrolysates. The fermentation was performed at 30 •C, 7.5 standard 
liter (sL)/h of an airflow rate, and 100 rpm of an agitation rate. pH was 
controlled by using 4 N KOH solutions to investigate the effect of pH on 
the culture. 
2.5. Quantitative analysis 
Cell growth was measured by OD600 using a UV–visible spectro -
photometer (BioMate 3S; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 
Sugars and extracellular metabolites were determined and quantified 
using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent 1200 
Series; Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, USA) equipped with a 
refractive index detector and Rezex ROA-Organic Acid H(8 %) column 
(Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA, USA). The samples were analyzed at 
50 •C with 0.005 M H2SO4 as the mobile phase, with a flow rate of 0.6 
mL/min. The culture broth was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, 
and supernatants were obtained to analyze extracellular metabolites and 
sugars in the medium. 
2.6. Techno-economic analysis 
Superpro Designer v9.5 (Intelligen, Inc., Scotch Plains, NJ, USA) was 
used to calculate the mass and energy balances of the processes. The 
following units of the process (see supplementary material ) were 
modeled in Superpro Designer: four blending tanks for making medium 
(three) and gypsum washing (one), four 400 tons fermentors for lactic 
acid production, three pasteurizer for medium sterilization, two neu-
tralizers for lactate acidification, two hydrocylones for gypsum removal, 
seven flat bottom tanks for product storage in the middle of the process 
(see supplementary material ). 
Capital costs were derived from direct and indirect expenses, using 
Superpro Designer v9.5 values. The annualized capital cost is calculated 
by multiplying the total capital cost by the capital recovery factor (CRF), 
which can be calculated as follows: 
CRFi1iN
1iN 1(1)  
where ’i’ is the interest rate (8 %) and ’N’ is the plant ’s operational 
lifespan (20 years), following assumptions from previous studies (Heo 
et al., 2019 ). 
The annual operating cost was calculated as the sum of materials, 
utilities, labor, maintenance, and Laboratory QC/QA costs. The material 
and utility costs were estimated based on the simulation results and unit 
prices of the chemicals and utilities. The labor cost is estimated using the 
following correlation equation (Heo et al., 2019 ): 
Labor cost106×Total capital cost
106×5000B2(2)  
The maintenance cost was estimated to be 2 % of the total capital cost, 
and the laboratory cost for quality control and assurance (Laboratory 
QC/QA) was estimated to be 8 % of the labor cost (Kwan et al., 2015 ). 
Finally, the annual cost was defined as the sum of the annualized capital 
cost and the annual operating cost. The lactic acid production cost was 
defined as follows: Y.-G. Lee et al.

3.Results and discussion 
3.1. Construction of engineered i. Orientalis strains capable of producing 
lactic acid from xylose 
First, an engineered I. orientalis capable of producing lactic acid from 
glucose with a high yield was constructed (Fig. 1). As I. orientalis SD108 
strain typically produces ethanol and glycerol as main bioproducts (Lee 
et al., 2022 ), pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and glyceraldehyde-3- 
phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) were deleted to block carbon fluxes 
toward ethanol and glycerol. Then, the gene encoding LmLDH (D-lactate 
dehydrogenase of L. mesenteroides ) that converts pyruvate to D-lactic 
acid was introduced, and the resulting strain was named SD108L. The 
SD108XL strain, consuming xylose and producing lactic acid, was con-
structed by introducing S. stipitis XR, XDH, and XK into the SD108L 
strain (Fig. 1). 
The phenotypes of the SD108L and SD108XL strains were examined 
(Fig. 2). As the production of lactic acid decreased the pH of culture 
media, 50 g/L calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), a neutralizing agent, was 
supplemented into the culture media. The SD108L consumed 38.7 g/L of 
glucose in 40 h and produced 28.7 g/L of lactic acid. The SD108XL strain 
consumed 44.0 g/L of xylose in 62 h and produced 28.1 g/L of lactic 
acid. Although the engineered I. orientalis strains consumed glucose 
faster than xylose, the cell densities (OD 600) were higher under xylose 
conditions (OD 600 14.1) than under glucose conditions (OD 600 4.0). 
While I. orientalis shows a Crabtree-positive response when fermenting 
glucose, engineered I. orientalis showed a weak Crabtree-positive 
response and produced more biomass when fermenting xylose. 
Another intriguing aspect of the xylose fermentation process is the 
production of byproducts, particularly xylitol. A previous study revealed 
that the ethanol-producing SD108 strain, while metabolizing xylose, 
produced 6 g/L of xylitol. However, the SD108XL strain produced only 1.4 g/L of xylitol (Lee et al., 2022 ). Similarly, when S. cerevisiae con-
verted xylose to lactic acid, it produced less xylitol than when making 
ethanol (Turner et al., 2015 ). These results indicated that a robust 
metabolic pathway was established in I. orientalis for the efficient con-
version of xylose to lactic acid. 
3.2. Production of lactic acid from a sorghum biomass hydrolysate with 
pH control 
It was attempted to produce lactic acid from a lignocellulosic hy-
drolysate using the SD108XL strain (Fig. 3). A sorghum biomass was pre- 
treated and hydrolyzed as described in Lee et al. (2022) , and the 
resulting hydrolysate containing 74.0 g/L of glucose and 42.3 g/L of 
xylose was used for producing lactic acid. Before the sorghum hydro -
lysate fermentation, the phenotype of the SD108XL strain was investi -
gated using the synthetic YP medium containing 73.1 g/L of glucose and 
45.4 g/L of xylose in a bioreactor. The pH was adjusted and maintained 
at pH 6 by adding KOH. As shown in Fig. 3A, the SD108XL strain 
consumed glucose and xylose completely within 49.5 h and 137 h, 
respectively. In the dominant glucose consumption phase (up to 49.5 h), 
the strain produced 50.6 g/L of lactic acid with a yield of 0.56 g lactic 
acid/g sugar (glucose and xylose) and a productivity of 1.02 g/L≡h. After 
glucose depletion, an additional 20.4 g/L lactic acid was produced from 
xylose with a yield of 0.76 g lactic acid/g xylose and a productivity of 
0.23 g/L≡h. 
The SD108XL strain was cultured using a sorghum hydrolysate in a 
shake-flask (Fig. 3B). Calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) was used as a 
neutralizing agent to prevent pH reduction caused by the accumulation 
of lactic acid. The SD108XL strain showed similar phenotypes as 
compared to the fermentation results in the synthetic medium (Fig. 3A). 
The SD108XL strain consumed glucose and xylose in the hydrolysates 
within 70 and 170 h, respectively, and produced 80.8 g/L lactic acid. 
The SD108XL strain produced lactic acid well by using lignocellulosic 
hydrolysate with the supplementation of calcium carbonate. Despite the 
potential presence of inhibitors like furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-

5furaldehyde (HMF) in sorghum hydrolysates (Lee et al., 2022 ), 
I. orientalis appears to exhibit resilience against these inhibitory 
compounds. 
This study aimed to produce organic acids without pH control to 
minimize the product recovery costs associated with neutralizing agents. 
However, the SD108XL strain hardly consumed glucose and xylose and 
produced little lactic acid without pH control (see supplementary ma-
terial s). When 107.8 g/L of glucose was provided, the SD108XL 
consumed only 41.4 g/L of glucose and produced 32.9 g/L of lactic acid 
without pH regulation (see supplementary material s). When a sugar 
mixture of glucose (66.4 g/L) and xylose (45.6 g/L) was used, the 
SD108XL strain produced 30.0 g/L of lactic acid by consuming only 
37.5 g/L of glucose with no xylose consumption (see supplementary 
material s). When more than 30 g/L of lactic acid was accumulated in the 
medium, the pH was around 3 (see supplementary material s). Even 
though I. orientalis is an acid-tolerant strain capable of growing well 
even under pH 3, high concentrations of lactic acid at pH 3 conditions 
seem to inhibit the growth and metabolism. These results indicate that 
pH control is still required for producing high levels of organic acids 
despite using I. orientalis (Park et al., 2018 ). 
On the other hand, I. orientalis is typically less affected by low pH 
when producing non-acidic substances. Lee et al. (2022) reported that 
I. orientalis produced ethanol by consuming all glucose and xylose in 
sorghum biomass hydrolysates without pH control (Lee et al., 2022 ). It 
was also confirmed that I. orientalis consumed 40 g/L of glucose and produced 17 g/L of ethanol without pH control, while pH decreased to 
2.2 (see supplementary material s). As such, I. orientalis appears to 
possess an unidentified mechanism that lowers the pH of cultures, 
further complicating the production of high amounts of organic acids. 
3.3. Effect of lactic acid on culture buffering 
Typically, similar amounts of weak acids and their conjugate base 
form a buffer. Based on this idea, it was hypothesized that lactic acid (a 
weak acid) produced by yeast during fermentation might act as a buffer 
for maintaining pH. In order to investigate if the lactic acid produced by 
cells can work as a buffer during fermentation, the SD108WT strain 
(ethanol-producing strain) was cultured in SC medium with 40 g/L 
glucose and different amounts of lactic acid. The initial pH was adjusted 
to 6 by KOH in all conditions (Fig. 4A). After 8.5 h of fermentation, 
OD600, residual glucose, ethanol, and medium pH were measured. The 
results showed that OD600 and ethanol production were similar 
regardless of initial lactic acid concentrations. However, interestingly, 
the supplementation of higher amounts of initial lactic acid resulted in 
smaller decreases in the pH of the culture media. The culture media pH 
decreased to 4 in the presence of 6.4 g/L of lactic acid, while it decreased 
to 2 with no supplementation of lactic acid, suggesting that the sup-
plemented lactic acid might be working as a buffer. 
To further investigate this buffering effect of initially added lactic

6acid, the SD108XL strain (lactic acid-producing strain) was cultured in 
the SC medium containing 40 g/L of glucose under three conditions: no 
pH control, supplemented with 6.4 g/L of lactic acid, and pH control 
using CaCO 3 (Fig. 4B). In the absence of pH control, the SD108XL strain 
consumed 18.6 g/L glucose and produced only 2.4 g/L of lactic acid, 
which can be attributed to a drastic decrease of pH to 2.5. In contrast, 
with pH control using CaCO 3, the SD108XL strain consumed all glucose 
and produced 28.2 g/L of lactic acid while maintaining a pH above 5. 
When 6.4 g/L of lactic acid was initially added to the culture medium, 
the pH was maintained around 3, resulting in much better glucose 
consumption (28.4 g/L of glucose) and lactic acid production (16.7 g/L of lactic acid) than those (10.9 g/L of glucose and 2.3 g/L of lactic acid) 
without lactic acid supplementation. While the SD108XL strain pro-
duced more lactic acid from glucose, the produced lactic acid and its 
conjugate base formed through supplementing lactic acid established a 
buffer system in the culture. Therefore, even as the SD108XL strain 
produced high amounts of lactic acid during fermentation, the pH did 
not decrease by Le Chatelier ’s Principle. Le Chatelier ’s Principle states 
that if an external change is applied to a system at equilibrium, the 
system will adjust itself to oppose the change until a new equilibrium is 
established. In the culture with lactic acid, the equilibrium exists be-
tween lactic acid (the weak acid) and its conjugate base form. When the

7SD108XL strain produced more lactic acid during fermentation, it 
changed the equilibrium between lactic acid and its conjugate base in 
the culture. Thus, the system would try to counteract this change by 
shifting the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form (lactate), 
thereby preventing a drastic decrease in pH. As a result, the pH of the 
culture remained relatively stable, and a substantial enhancement in 
fermentation performance was achieved as compared to no pH control. 
Additionally, in the same 6.4 g/L lactic acid conditions, the SD108XL 
strain producing lactic acid exhibited a lower pH (pH 3, Fig. 4B) in 
contrast to the SD108WT (pH 4, Fig. 4A) producing ethanol, primarily 
due to the lactic acid generated by the SD108XL strain. 
3.4. A self-buffering fermentation strategy for producing lactic acid by 
engineered i. Orientalis 
A self-buffering strategy was then applied to a bioreactor fermenta -
tion (Fig. 5). During the fermentation, the lactic acid produced by the 
SD108XL strain would be converted to the conjugate base form by initial 
pH control with KOH. After stopping the pH control, newly produced 
lactic acid would be accumulated in the medium, establishing a buff-
ering system. When the SD108XL strain was cultured with 106.3 g/L of 
glucose (Fig. 5A), the pH of the culture medium was maintained at 6.0 
for the first 22.5 h. During this pH control period, the SD108XL strain 
consumed 36.0 g/L glucose and produced 24.5 g/L lactic acid. Then, the 
pH control was turned off. Even though pH control was discontinued 
after 22.5 h, the SD108XL consumed all glucose and produced 74.0 g/L 
of lactic acid with a yield of 0.70 g lactic acid/g glucose while main -
taining steady pH levels around 3.7. In contrast, without pH control (see 
supplementary material s), the SD108XL strain consumed only 41.3 g/L 
of glucose, while 107.8 g/L glucose was supplied and produced 32.9 g/L 
of lactic acid with a yield of 0.80 g lactic acid/g glucose and the pH of the 
culture medium decreased to 2.7. 
This self-buffering strategy was also applied to mixed sugar 
fermentation with 68.9 g/L of glucose and 47.3 g/L of xylose (Fig. 5B). 
In the first 22 h of the mixed sugar fermentation, the pH of the culture 
medium was maintained at 6 by adding KOH until a substantial amount 
of lactate produced to establish a self-buffering system. When a lactic 
acid concentration reached 21.4 g/L after the SD108XL strain consumed 
36.7 g/L of glucose and 10.7 g/L of xylose, pH control was stopped. 
Nonetheless, the SD108XL continued to produce lactic acid, consuming 
glucose completely (68.9 g/L) and a substantial amount (20.4 g/L) of 
xylose. The final lactic acid concentration was 56.4 g/L with a yield of 
0.63 g lactic acid/g consumed sugar (glucose and xylose) while main -
taining a pH of 3.9. While the self-buffering approach proved to be an 
effective strategy to maintain pH with minimum amounts of a neutral -
izing agent, the short period of pH control was not sufficient to enable 
efficient and rapid fermentation of xylose into lactic acid in the mixed sugar conditions (Fig. 5B). This result suggests that xylose fermentation 
might be more susceptible to high levels of lactic acid at low pH con-
ditions than glucose fermentation by engineered I. orientalis . 
There are several factors that might contribute to these observations. 
First, in the SD108XL strain, both PDC and GPD were deleted. PDC is 
responsible for catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate to acetaldehyde, 
which is subsequently converted to ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase 
(ADH), oxidizing NADH into NAD(Fig. 1). Consequently, if PDC is 
deleted, 1 mol of NADH is accumulated in the cytosol if 1 mol of py-
ruvate needs to be metabolized (Tran et al., 2023 ). This accumulated 
NADH can be utilized by LDH in the production of lactic acid. However, 
with the deletion of GPD as well, additional NADH can accumulate 
within the cell. This imbalance in NADH levels might impact xylose 
metabolism. When xylose is metabolized via XR and XDH, XR produces 
NADP, but XDH produces NADH, generating surplus NADH. Therefore, 
the deletion of PDC and GPD, causing higher NADH levels in the cytosol, 
might interfere with xylose metabolism negatively (Fig. 1). Conversely, 
in a previous study, when an engineered SD108 strain produced ethanol 
from xylose, there were no adverse effects on xylose consumption, even 
under low pH conditions (around pH 3) (Lee et al., 2022 ). This suggests 
that when PDC and GPD are not deleted, cells can maintain NADH 
balance, allowing for efficient ethanol production and xylose utilization 
even under low pH conditions (pH 3). Furthermore, low pH conditions 
can negatively affect the activity of the introduced xylose metabolism 
enzymes (XR, XDH, and XK). Considering the relatively high optimal pH 
of these enzymes (F6), lower pH levels of the culture could negatively 
impact their enzymatic activities in xylose metabolism, resulting in poor 
xylose utilization (Han et al., 2020 ). 
For the efficient conversion of glucose and xylose into organic acids, 
it is crucial to use as much glucose and xylose as possible to achieve high 
titers of organic acids. As the SD108XL strain had challenges with xylose 
consumption at pH 3.9, it was attempted to enhance the pH by 
increasing the buffering capacity during fermentation. To improve the 
buffering capacity, higher lactic acid and its conjugate base are required. 
Thus, the duration of pH control was extended until glucose was 
completely consumed (Fig. 5C). The SD108XL strain consumed almost 
all glucose in 41 h and produced 51.7 g/L of lactic acid. After ceasing pH 
control at 41 h, the pH level dropped to 4.3, which was higher than that 
observed in short pH control fermentations (as depicted in Fig. 5B). 
Consequently, xylose consumption improved with the extended pH 
control, and lactic acid concentration increased to 67.1 g/L with a yield 
of 0.59 g lactic acid/g sugar (glucose and xylose). Even though lactic 
acid titer increased due to the consumption of more xylose, the yield of 
lactic acid (0.59 g lactic acid/g sugar) under mixed sugar conditions 
(72.8 g/L of glucose and 51.9 g/L of xylose, Fig. 5C) was lower than the 
yield (0.75 g lactic acid/g glucose) under 106.3 g/L of glucose condi -
tions (Fig. 5A). 
Fig. 5.Self-buffering fermentation of the SD108XL strain. (A) The fermentation of the SD108XL strain was conducted in YP medium with about 110 g/L of glucose, 
and the pH was maintained at 6 for the first 22.5 h. (B) The fermentation of the SD108XL strain was conducted in YP medium with 70 g/L of glucose and 40 g/L of

xylose, and the pH was regulated for the first 41 h. Y.-G. Lee et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bioresource Technology 399 (2024) 130641
8This result suggests that the conversion of xylose into lactic acid was 
inefficient —the consumed xylose might be wasted for maintenance 
energy —during the mixed sugar (glucose and xylose) fermentation 
(Fig. 5B and 5C). When xylose was used as a sole carbon source with pH 
control, the SD108XL strain efficiently converted xylose into biomass 
and lactic acid with a yield of 0.64 g lactic acid/g xylose (Fig. 2B). 
However, during the mixed sugar fermentation, xylose is consumed after 
glucose is depleted. High levels of lactic acid accumulated from glucose 
consumption might cause the inhibition of xylose metabolism and in-
crease maintenance energy as well. A previous 13C metabolic flux 
analysis study revealed that xylose metabolism activated the TCA cycle 
and reduced the glycolytic pathway compared to glucose utilization 
(Gonzalez et al., 2017 ). As such, when the SD108XL strain metabolizes 
xylose after glucose depletion, xylose appears to be primarily used for 
activating the TCA cycle, generating additional maintenance energy to 
counter unfavorable conditions rather than producing biomass and 
lactic acid. Consequently, despite implementing the self-buffering 
strategy, the yield and productivity of lactic acid on xylose during the 
stationary phase remained low. Therefore, further advancements in 
bioprocessing and strain engineering are needed to enhance lactic acid 
production from glucose and xylose. 
Nevertheless, the engineered I. orientalis strain and self-buffered 
fermentation approach showed significant potential for the industrial 
production of organic acids from glucose and xylose. Traditionally, 
S. cerevisiae has been mainly studied for the production of lactic acid. 
While these studies reported higher titers and yields, they utilized only 
glucose as a substrate and neutralizing agents throughout the fermen -
tation process (Mitsui et al., 2020; Song et al., 2016; Watcharawipas 
et al., 2021 ). Conversely, in this study, lactic acid production was ach-
ieved from a mixed of glucose and xylose, utilizing a self-buffering 
strategy at a pH of 4.3. This pH level is generally lower than that re-
ported in other studies, with the exception of the work by Baek et al., 
(2017) , who enhanced a lactic acid production capability through 
adaptive laboratory evolution (Baek et al., 2017 ). In their approach, the 
engineered S. cerevisiae was gradually exposed to increasing levels of 
lactic acid. This led to the strain that produced lactic acid with a titer of 
83 g/L and a yield of 0.83 g/g glucose, 24 % and 38 % higher than the 
results of this study by I. orientalis , respectively. Consequently, it is ex-
pected that employing an adaptive evolution approach with the 
SD108XL strain could further improve lactic acid production efficiency, 
even under more acidic conditions. 
3.5. Techno-economic analysis of the self-buffering strategy for the 
production of lactic acid by i. Orientalis 
A techno-economic analysis (TEA) was conducted to compare the 
economic viability of a self-buffering strategy against the traditional pH 
control method in lactic acid production. The lactic acid production 
process encompasses several stages, including feedstock preparation, 
liquefaction, saccharification, fermentation, acidification, gypsum sep-
aration, and purification (see supplementary material ) (Manandhar & 
Shah, 2023; Marchesan et al., 2021 ). In this study, the analysis mainly 
focused on the fermentation with pH control, acidification, and gypsum 
separation stages (Gezae Daful & Gorgens, 2017 ). The process was 
modeled and simulated by Superpro Designer v9.5 (see supplementary 
material ). The experimental data (the fermentation dynamics, lactic 
acid yields, and consumption of carbon sources) were used to simulate 
the processes (referenced in Fig. 3A and 5C, respectively). In the TEA, 
calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) was selected over KOH (used experi -
mentally in this study) for neutralization during fermentation to align 
with conventional practices. In the acidification step, sulfuric acid 
(H2SO4) facilitated the conversion of lactate to lactic acid, generating 
gypsum as a byproduct. Gypsum removal was achieved using hydro -
cyclones, followed by washing to extract residual lactic acid. Key process 
parameters and assumptions are also summarized in the supplementary 
material . The pH control and self-buffering strategies were simulated with the 
goal of producing 1,000 metric tons (MT) of lactic acid. The TEA result 
revealed that the self-buffering method required significantly lesser 
quantities of Ca(OH) 2 and H2SO4, specifically 100 MT less of Ca(OH) 2 
and 134 MT less of H2SO4 compared to the conventional pH control 
strategy (see supplementary material ). This strategic reduction in 
chemical use led to decreased gypsum production. Consequently, there 
was a reduced need for washing water, with the process consuming 547 
MT less water for gypsum washing in the self-buffering process. More -
over, the lower gypsum output also led to a decrease in the energy 
required for its separation in hydrocyclones, resulting in a significant 
energy saving of 507,851 kWh. This efficiency in energy use for gypsum 
separation further underscores the environmental and operational cost 
benefits of the self-buffering strategy in lactic acid production. 
The self-buffering approach not only resulted in a leaner process flow 
with reduced reaction volume compared to the pH-controlled scenario 
but also manifested in lower capital and operational costs for the same 
volume of lactic acid production. Accordingly, the production cost under 
self-buffering conditions was $40.2/kg, indicating a cost advantage of 
10 % over the pH control method (Table 2). These findings highlight the 
economic and environmental benefits of a self-buffering strategy for 
lactic acid production. 
4.Conclusion 
This study demonstrated the cost-effective production of lactic acid 
using the acid-tolerant yeast, I. orientalis . The engineered strain, 
SD108XL, efficiently processed glucose and xylose in lignocellulosic 
hydrolysates but struggled without pH control. To address this issue, a 
self-buffering strategy was employed to maintain a pH of around 4, 
enhancing sugar consumption and lactic acid production while mini-
mizing the need for neutralizing agents. The techno-economic analysis 
revealed that the self-buffering strategy could reduce production costs, 
demonstrating the feasibility of I. orientalis for efficient organic acid 
production.
