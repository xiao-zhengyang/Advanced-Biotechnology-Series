Abstract
This study investigates biofuel production from wheat straw hydrolysate, from which furfural was extracted using a patented
method developed at the Latvian State Institute of Wood Chemistry. The solid remainder after furfural extraction, correspondingto 67.6% of the wheat straw dry matter, contained 69.9% cellulose of which 4% was decomposed during the furfural extraction
and 26.3% lignin. Enzymatic hydrolysis released 44% of the glucose monomers in the cellulose. The resulting hydrolysate
contained mainly glucose and very little amount of acetic acid. Xylose was not detectable. Consequently, the undiluted hydro-lysate did not inhibit growth of yeast strains belonging to Saccharomyces cerevisiae ,Lipomyces starkeyi ,a n d Rhodotorula
babjevae . In the fermentations, average final ethanol concentrations of 23.85 g/l were obtained, corresponding to a yield of
0.53 g ethanol per g released glucose. L. starkeyi generated lipids with a rate of 0.08 g/h and a yield of 0.09 g per g consumed
glucose. R. babjevae produced lipids with a rate of 0.18 g/h and a yield of 0.17 per g consumed glucose. In both yeasts,
desaturation increased during cultivation. Remarkably, the R. babjevae strain used in this study produced considerable amounts
of heptadecenoic, α,- and γ-linolenic acid.

Introduction
Lignocellulose is very attractive as raw material for biofuel
and chemicals ’production, as it is the most abundant biomass
on Earth and has less impact on feed and food production and
results in greater greenhouse gas savings compared to food
grade, first generation s ubstrates (Gnansounou 2010 ,
Özdenkçi et al. 2017 ). However, due to its recalcitrance, en-
ergy intense and expensive thermo-chemical and enzymaticpretreatments are required to decompose lignocellulose into
its basic building blocks, to make them available for further
processing (Özdenkçi et al. 2017 ). During pretreatment, a va-
riety of compounds such as furfural and acetic acid are formed
that may act as inhibitors in subsequent fermentation process-
es (Jönsson and Martin 2016 ). On the other hand, furfural has
been identified as one of the major biomass-based platform
chemicals for chemical industry to produce biofuels, fuel ad-ditives, and other high-value compounds. This natural dehy-
dration product of xylose and other pentoses is industrially
produced from hemicellulose-rich substrates such as corncobsor sugarcane bagasse.
The global annual production of furfural at 2010 has been
reported to be around 300,000 t (Dashtban et al. 2014 ), and it
is expected that at 2020, the global furfural market will reach
650,000 t (GrandViewResearch 2015 ). Currently, no technol-
ogy for chemical synthesis of furfural does exist, and thus,furfural is the most abundant industrial chemical that is de-
rived from lignocellulose. However, its global market volume
is largely stagnating. This is mainly due to the inefficientprocesses of current furfural production, which makes it diffi-
cult to compete with fossil-based chemicals. The majority of
current industrial furfural processes are based on a technology

https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9081-7that was developed in the 1920 ’sb yQ u a k e rO a t s( I o w a ,
USA). This process does not reach 50% of the potential max-
imum yield. Apart from this, current industrial furfural pro-duction processes tend to also damage the cellulose fraction of
the biomass, making it very difficult to convert this polysac-
charide to glucose and further to ethanol (Win 2005 ,L a n g ee t
al.2012 , Cai et al. 2014 , Rapoport et al. 2014 , Machado et al.
2016 ).
At the Latvian State Institute of Wood Chemistry, novel
methods of thermochemical treatment of lignocellulose have
been developed, enabling a higher furfural yield compared to
previously established methods. This process is based on theinjection of a strong acid and certain salts, enabling differen-
tial catalysis of hydrolysis an d dehydration (Vedernikovs
2011, Cai et al. 2014 ). For instance, obtaining about 80% of
the theoretical maximum of furfural yield from birch wood
has been reported. Moreover, most of the cellulose fraction
remained intact (Vedernikovs et al. 2010 ). A commercial-
scale furfural process based on this method has been
established in 2006 in Iran (Cai et al. 2014 ). Such a process
may enable subsequent production of biofuels, such as ethanolor microbial biodiesel from the solid residue of furfural pro-
duction. Combined production of furfural and ethanol has
been calculated to be very advantageous in terms of fossil
oil replacement and greenhouse gas emission (Raman and
Gnansounou 2015 ). However, there are only few studies in-
vestigating biofuel production from the remainder of furfural
extraction (Cai et al. 2014 , Yoo et al. 2012 ).
In the present study, we investigated the potential of wheat
straw after furfural extraction for the co-production of ethanol
or biodiesel. After degradation of the residue by standard cel-
lulosic enzymes, the use of the hydrolysate as a substrate foreither ethanol- or biolipid production was tested. For the
biolipid production, we tested the production potential of
two different oleaginous yeasts, the ascomycete Lipomyces
starkeyi and the basidiomycete Rhodotorula babjevae ,a s
there is a huge diversity among the oleaginous yeasts, and
optimal yeast strains for each process still need to beestablished.
Materials and methods
Wheat straw hydrolysate
Winter wheat BZentos ^straw was obtained from a local farm
close to Riga, Latvia. Its composition and that of the solidremainder after furfural extraction was determined using stan-
dard methods (Technical Association of the Pulp, Paper and
Converting Industry- TAPPI): extractives (TAPPI 204), hemi-celluloses (TAPPI 203 cm-99), lignin (TAPPI 222), and ashes
(European Standard EN 14775) (Obolenskaya et al. 1965 ,
Zakis 2008 ). Cellulose was determined by the Kürschnerand Hoffer method (Kürschner and Hoffner 1931 ).
Approximately 2 g of sample was treated with 100 ml of a
1:4 (v/vnitric acide-ethanol) mixture and then raised to boiling
for 1 h. After filtration, the insoluble residue was retreated
twice using the same process. Finally, the solid was washed
with distilled water until neutrality of the sewage liquid (pHpaper coloration). Then the solid was dried to constant weight
at 105 ± 3 °C and weighed.
From the wheat straw, furfural was extracted at the pilot
plant at the Latvian State Institute of Wood Chemistry. Briefly,
the straw was crushed with a Wiley-type mill (Cutting mill
SM 100, Retsch GmbH & Co, Haan, Germany), to a particlesize 10 –20 mm and particles that could pass through a 2-mm
sieve and then mixed with an acid catalyst solution (0.1 g
catalyst solution per g dry weight of straw were added) usinga blade mixer. The obtained material was treated with a stream
of water steam during 60 min at 150 °C, in a thermochemical
processing unit. Furfural was obtained from the steam con-densate (Vedernikovs et al. 2010 ); the obtained yield was
0.11 g furfural per g dry mass of wheat straw, which is equal
to an extraction efficiency of 69% of the maximally possiblefurfural yield from this material. After water vapour stream
treatment, the solid fraction containing the lignocellulosic left-
over was washed with distilled water in the same reactor at
1 1 0° Ca n da tap r e s s u r eo f0 . 0 5M P a .A f t e ra1 0 - m i ni n c u b a -
tion, the liquid was removed by filtering through a sieve (meshsize 1.5 mm) in the bottom of the reactor. Washing of the
residue was repeated four times; the total amount of water
was 12 l per kg of solid matter. Subsequently, the material(moisture content 81 –83%) was emptied from the reactor
and dried at room temperature to a moisture content of 7 –
10%.
Enzymatic hydrolysis of the solid residue after furfural
extraction
The solid residue from furfural extraction was treated with
biomass degrading enzymes to obtain soluble sugar for etha-nol and lipid generation. Hydrolysis was performed in a bio-
reactor as described earlier (Frankó et al. 2015 ) with some
modifications: Treatment was performed with 15 filter paperunits Cellic CTec3 enzyme co cktail (Novozyme A/S,
Bagsværd, Denmark) per g dry weight at pH 4.8.
Yeast cultivation
For the different fermentation experiments, the yeast strains S.
cerevisiae J672 (industrial isolate from Agroetanol AB,
Norrköping Sweden, Blomqvist et al. 2010 ),R. babjevae
DBVPG 8058 (Industrial Yeasts Collection, Perugia, Italy,originally strain number J195, strain collection of the
Department of Microbiology, Swedish University of
Agricultural Sciences, isolated from apple), and L. starkeyiAppl Microbiol BiotechnolCBS 1807 were used. The strains were stored in glycerol
stocks containing 50% YPD and 50% glycerol at −80 °C
and pre-cultivated on YPD agar plates (20 g/l glucose, 20 g/lpeptone, 10 g/l yeast extract, 15 g/l agar) at 25 °C.
For toxicity tests of the enzymatic hydrolysate and to de-
termine the impact of addition of different levels of nitrogen,cells were cultivated at 25 °C on an orbital shaker at 125 rpm
in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks in three different media: (i) 10 ml
of hydrolysate (pure hydrolysate), (ii) 9 mL of hydrolysateplus 1 mLYNB/yeast extract (YNB: yeast nitrogen base with-
out amino acids and ammonium sulphate, Difco ™,B e c t o n
Dickinson & Co., Stockholm), final concentrations in the me-dium YNB 2 g/l, yeast extract, 0.75 g/l, ammonium sulphate
(Merck, Solna, Sweden) 2 g/L; low-nitrogen variant, or (iii)
9 mL of hydrolysate and 1 mL peptone (Merck)/yeast extract(final concentrations: peptone 20 g/L, yeast extract 10 g/L);
high-nitrogen variant. The pH was adjusted to 5.0 using 1 M
NaOH. Every 24 h, samples were taken for determining opti-cal density at 600 nm (OD
600) (Biochrom WPA CO8000 Cell
density meter), pH, and the concentrations of sugar and
ethanol.
Fermentation experiments for testing the ethanol potential
were performed in triplicates, for testing the lipid production,
potential fermentations were performed in duplicates, in 0.7-L
bioreactors (Multifors, Bottmingen, Switzerland) in 300-ml
hydrolysate at 30 °C. To determine the ethanol productionpotential of the hydrolysate, fermentations were run with S.
cerevisiae , at an oxygen tension of 0%. The fermenter was
flushed with N
2before inoculation; during fermentation, the
gas flow was switched off. For lipid production, oxygen ten-
sion was adjusted to 20%, and fermentations were performed
with either L. starkeyi orR. babjevae .S. cerevisiae was inoc-
ulated to an initial OD 600of 1, both oleaginous yeasts to an
OD 600of 10. To obtain the inoculum, the yeasts were pre-
grown in liquid YPD at 25 °C and 130 rpm on an orbitalshaker in baffled 500-ml shake flasks containing 100-ml me-
dia.S. cerevisiae was pre-cultivated for 24 h. L. starkeyi was
grown for 72 h and R. babjevae for 48 h; before inoculation,
the cells were washed twice with saline (9 g/l NaCl solution).
The oleaginous yeasts were adapted to nitrogen limitation in
YNB media (70 g/L glucose, 1.7 g/L YNB, 2 g/L ammoniumsulphate, 0.75 g/L yeast extract) over night at the same condi-
tions as described above.
Analytical methods
Yeast cell biomass was quantified by OD measurements or
direct in 2-mL samples by drying as described in
Brandenburg et al. ( 2016). Correlations were established for
OD and dry matter. For S. cerevisiae , 1 OD corresponded to a
dry matter of 0.37 g, as described earlier (Blomqvist et al.
2010). For L. starkeyi , 1 OD corresponded to a dry matter of
0.19 g; for R. babjevae , 1 OD corresponded to 0.16 g. The cellswere harvested by centrifugation at 17,000 g, washed twice
with distilled water, and dried at 105 °C for 48 h. Glucose,
acetic acid, glycerol, and eth anol were determined by HPLC
as previously described (Fredlund et al. 2004). For a rapid test-
ing, glucose concentration of the medium was measured using
Medi-Test Glucose strips (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany)as described earlier (Blomqvist et al. 2012). Lipids of the ole-
aginous yeasts were extracted using a modified Bligh & Dyer
method (Brandenburg et al. 2016, Folch et al. 1957). One hun-
dred milligrams of freeze-dried yeast cells were suspended in
1 ml 1 M HCl, soaked for 15 min and incubated for 1 h at
75 °C. Five milliliters of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v)w a s
added, and the tube was vortexed for 15 min at highest speed.
The solution was centrifuged at 5000 g for 3 min at room
temperature, and the lipid layer was transferred to a pre-weighted tube. The remaining c ontent of the sample was re-
extracted by adding 2.5 ml chloroform, mixing by 1min-
vortexing and centrifugation at 3000 g for 5 min. The lipidphase was added to the first extraction, and the solvent was
evaporated under N
2. Lipids were quantified gravimetrically.
As lipid extraction is laborious and requires a substantialamount of fermentation medium and because it was not the
purpose of this study to follow t he kinetics of lipid formation,
lipid concentration was only de termined at the beginning and
end of each fermentation with the oleaginous yeasts. For deter-
mination of the fatty acid composition, the fatty acids weremethylated by addition of BF
3according to Appelqvist
(1968), and the methyl esters were analysed by gas chromatog-
raphy (GC) as recently described (Olstorpe et al. 2014 ,
Brandenburg et al. 2016). Fatty acids were identified according
to standard mixture 68A (Nu-Check, Elysian, MN) and reten-
tion times. The double binding or unsaturation index (UI) wascalculated as UI[%] = [%16:1 + %17:1 + %18:1 + (%18:2)·2 +
(%18:3)·3]/100.
Nitrogen in the hydrolysate was quantified by Kjeldahl
analysis, using Cu as catalyst (Kjeldahl 1883 ). Analysis was
performed at Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,
Department of Animal Nutrition and Management. Standarddeviation of the analysis was stated as maximum 0.9% of the
totally determined concentration.
Results
Composition of wheat straw and the residue
after furfural extraction
The wheat straw used in the experiments contained (see
Materials and Methods) 29.4% (± 0.3) hemicellulose, 47.2%
(± 0.4) cellulose, and 17.8% (± 0.6) lignin. After furfural ex-traction (resulting in 110 g furfural per kg total straw dry
matter), a solid residue was obtained, corresponding to
67.6% of the wheat straw dry matter.Appl Microbiol BiotechnolAnalysis of the solid residue identified that it mainly
consisted of cellulose (69.9%) of which 4% was decomposed
during the furfural extraction process, and lignin (26.3%).
Enzymatic digest of the solid residue of furfural
extraction
Enzymatic degradation of the solid residue was performed,
with a final concentration of water insoluble solids (WIS) of145 g/L. The final glucose concentration from enzymatic hy-
drolysis was 44.6 g/L, corresponding to 44% of the cellulose
present in the solid residue. There were almost no other com-pounds found in the hydrolysate; no xylose was found, and
acetic acid concentration was below 0.1 g/L. The nitrogen
content was 82 mg N/L.
Growth of yeasts on the enzymatic hydrolysate
To check the hydrolysate for inhibitory characteristics, and to
check whether an addition of nitrogen is required in the sub-
sequent fermentation steps, the ethanol production yeast S.
cerevisiae and the oleaginous yeasts L. starkeyi and R.
babjevae were tested for growth in the hydrolysate at different
nitrogen additions. All tested strains were able to grow inundiluted hydrolysate. S. cerevisiae consumed all sugar dur-
ing the first 24 h of cultivation under all three different nitro-
gen supplies. However, there were differences in the finaloptical density. In pure hydrolysate, S. cerevisiae reached a
maximum OD
600of 12 (± 0.3), at low-nitrogen addition 20 (±
0), and at high-nitrogen addition 40 (± 0). The oleaginousyeasts consumed the glucose slower than S. cerevisiae .L.
starkeyi had consumed all sugar after 48 h in the two cultiva-
tions with nitrogen addition and after 72 h in the pure hydro-lysate. R. babjevae consumed all sugar after 48 h in the culti-
vation with high nitrogen addition; in hydrolysate with lownitrogen addition and in pure hydrolysate, complete sugar
consumption was monitored after 72 h. The maximum obtain-
ed OD
600was for L. starkeyi 17.3 (± 1.1), 20 (± 0), and 40 (±
0) in pure hydrolysate, and hydrolysate with low- and high-
nitrogen addition, respectively. R. babjevae reached 15.7 (±
1.8), 20 (± 0), and 60 (± 0), respectively.
Ethanol production from the hydrolysate
Ethanol production from undiluted hydrolysate was tested in a
bioreactor under low-oxygen conditions. The medium was
first sparged with N 2, and then S. cerevisiae was added to
the fermentation broth to an initial OD of 1.0. The fermenta-
tion was followed until the glucose was finished, which hap-
pened within 27 h (Fig. 1). The ethanol yield was calculated
from the final ethanol concentration divided by the consumed
glucose (100% of the glucose was consumed and no ethanol
assimilation was observed). In the fermentations, average finalethanol concentrations of 23.85 g/L were obtained, corre-
sponding to a yield of 0.53 g ethanol per g released glucose
(± 0.01). This is above the theoretical maximum of the ethanolyield from glucose. Probably, some oligosaccharide residues
were still present in the fermentation broth, together with
some cellulase enzyme, which released additional sugarmonomers during fermentation.
Lipid production from the hydrolysate
Lipid production was tested using two oleaginous yeast spe-cies, the ascomycete L. starkeyi and the basidiomycete R.
babjevae . Both yeasts were after pre-cultivation pre-grown
in low-nitrogen medium, to induce the metabolic pathways
resulting in lipid accumulation. Lipid formation was calculat-ed from the difference between the amounts of lipids in the
yeast cell biomass at the start of the cultivation and after the

in undiluted enzymatic hydrolysate. The cultures were inocu-
lated to a dry matter content of 1.95 g/L. Initial lipid content ofthe cells of L. starkeyi was 10.7% of dry matter, corresponding
to an initial lipid concentration in the cultures of 0.21 g/L.
Glucose was consumed within 48 h; dry matter increased to11.72 ± 0.46 g/L with a lipid content of 31.89 ± 0.6% (Fig. 2).
Thus, a lipid amount of 3.48 ± 0.18 g/L was produced. This
corresponds to a total production rate of 0.08 ± 0.01 g/L h anda lipid yield of 0.09 ± 0.01 g per g consumed glucose. The
final production of lipid per solid residue was thus 24 g per
kg solid residue.
R. babjevae consumed the glucose already within 40 h. The
initial biomass in the parallels was 1.1 g/L, with a lipid content
of 10.95%. Thus, the initial lipid concentration in the culturewas 0.12 g/L. After 40 h, biomass dry matter was 16.48 ±
0.4 g/L, with a lipid content of 43.9 ± 1.32% (Fig. 3). This
corresponded to an amount of produced lipids of 7.14 ±0.02 g/L, a lipid production rate of 0.18 ± 0.0 g/h, and a lipid
yield of 0.17 ± 0.0 g per g consumed glucose. Thus, when
using R. babjevae to convert the hydrolysate to lipids, 49.2 g
lipids per kg solid residue were obtained.
Fatty acid profiles of L. starkeyi and R. babjevae
The fatty acid profiles of the two oleaginous yeasts at the start
and the end of the fermentations are shown in Table 1.B o t h
yeasts showed substantial differences in their overall fatty acidcomposition. At the beginning of the cultivation, the major
fatty acid was oleic acid (C18:1) in both yeast, but in R.
babjevae , this fatty acid contributed more than 60.0% of all
fatty acids, while it was 44.1% in L. starkeyi . Other substantial
fatty acids in L. starkeyi at the beginning of fermentation were
palmitic acid (C16:0, 32%), palmitoleic acid (C16:1, 5.2%),
stearic acid (C18:0, 6.8%), and linoleic acid (C18:2, 9.2%).
After cultivation of L. starkeyi in the hydrolysate, a variety ofchanges in the fatty acid profile were observed. There was a
slight decrease in the number of saturated and monounsaturat-
ed fatty acids, while the proportion of linoleic acid increasedto 18.9%. Moreover, a detectable amount of α-linolenic acid
(C18:3 n-3, 2.6%) was observed.
InR. babjevae , at the beginning of the cultivation apart
from the dominating oleic acid (63.4%), palmitic acid
(16.0%), stearic acid (4.5%), and linoleic acid (7.1%) were
found in noteworthy proportions. After a 40-h cultivation,the proportion of oleic acid had substantially decreased and
was with 23.3% in the range of heptadecenoic acid (C17:1,
21.8%). C17:1 was the fatty acid with the largest increase, as itwas only present with a very low proportion (1.5%) at the
beginning of the cultivation. Also in the basidiomycetous
yeast, there was a tendency that the proportion of saturatedfatty acids and most of the single unsaturated (except C17:1)
decreased. Polyunsaturated fatty acids increased, including
linoleic acid, α-a n d γ-linolenic acid, and the latter up to a
proportion of more than 10% (Table 1).
Discussion
Current industrial methods for furfural production tend to
damage the cellulose fraction of the residual material, whichmakes it impossible to produce biofuels from these residues
(Cai et al. 2014 , Machado et al. 2016 ). In this study, we in-
vestigated the biofuel potential of the cellulosic residue afterfurfural extraction, using the method developed at the Latvian
Institute of Wood Chemistry (Vedernikovs 2011), where 110 g
furfural have been extracted per kg wheat straw. Enzymatictreatment hydrolysed 44% of total cellulose. This can be as-
sumed as a good proportion, compared to other studies on
wheat straw. From wheat straw pretreated with diluted acid,
only 25% of the cellulose co u l db ed e g r a d e dt og l u c o s e

deviation from the mean valueAppl Microbiol Biotechnoland microbial pretreatment, 25 –50% of the cellulose was con-
verted to glucose (Passoth et al. 2013 ). Probably, even higher
values of cellulose degradation might be possible when using
simultaneous saccharification and fermentation, to avoid feed-back inhibition of cellulase, and in general, by using improved
enzyme cocktails (Atreya et al. 2016 ).
The enzymatic hydrolysate had almost no inhibitory potential
on the yeasts used in this study. Obviously, the furfural extraction
and the washing step at the end of the thermochemical treatment
had removed most fermentation inhibitors. Accordingly, all three
yeasts, including the two more in hibitor sensitive oleaginous
species could grow on undiluted hydrolysate. In earlier experi-ments, hydrolysate had to be diluted by a factor of 3 –10, to get
non-adapted yeasts to grow (Blomqvist et al. 2011, Tiukova et al.
2014, Brandenburg et al. 2016). In the ethanol fermentation, the
theoretical maximum of ethanol production was reached; in fact,
slightly more ethanol was produced than it could be expected
according to the measured amount of glucose in the medium.This was probably due to some cellulase activity present in the
hydrolysate, and due to this, sugar releases during fermentation.
Our study, apart from testing the ethanol potential, repre-
sents the first attempt to generate lipids from the solid residue
of furfural production. We found considerable differences be-
tween the two tested yeast strains when grown on the testedsubstrate, with R. babjevae (lipid yield 0.17 and production
rate 0.18 g/L h) being superior over L. starkeyi (0.09 and
0.08 g/L h). The physiological basis of this difference on the
same substrate is not clear; however, it fits well to results onother lignocellulose hydrolysate, where L. starkeyi -strains pro-
duced rather low lipid amounts compared to other oleaginous
yeasts (Slininger et al. 2016). The order of magnitude of the
lipid yield of L. starkeyi was similar to a recent study in our
group, where we obtained the highest lipid yield from hemicel-
lulose hydrolysate that has been reported so far (Brandenburg
et al. 2016). Between the two tested species, R. babjevae seems
to be the yeast of choice in terms of further research for biofuelproduction from lignocellulose. The obtained lipid yield- and -
production rate were also relatively high compared to other
oleaginous yeasts, cultivated on either lignocellulosic hydroly-sate or a glucose-based model substrate (Slininger et al. 2016,
Shen et al. 2013). In recent system analyses, we pointed out that
rapid conversion of the substrate to lipids has great impact onthe sustainability of the conversion, because aerobic cultiva-
tions, as required for lipid production, require much energy,
implying that a faster fermentation will largely improve processefficiency (Karlsson et al. 2016, Karlsson et al. 2017).

babjevae DBVPG 8058. Two
independent cultivations wereperformed; the figure shows mean
values and deviation from the
mean valueAppl Microbiol Biotechnolthe desaturation of fatty acids was observed. Previous studies
have shown an increase of the UI as a response to lowered
cultivation temperatures, which is keeping the membrane flu-idity on an according level (e.g. Beltran et al. 2008 , Rossi et al.
2009 ,A m a r e t t ie ta l . 2010 ,O l s t o r p ee ta l . 2014 ). However, in
our experiments, the cultivation temperature was 30 °C, andthus low temperature cannot be the reason for increased
desaturation. Moreover, in oleaginous yeasts, membrane
lipids represent only a small proportion of the total lipid con-tent; most of the lipids must thus have been storage lipids. It is
unclear why the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in-
creased in both yeasts, but since both yeasts belong to differ-ent fungal phyla and have a very high phylogenetic distance,
this increase seems to be a conserved response. There was also
a remarkable increase of heptadecenoic acid, C17:1 in R.
babjevae during growth on hydrolysate. The occurrence of
this fatty acid in yeasts has rarely been reported (Beltran et
al.2008 , Rossi et al. 2009 , Tronchoni et al. 2012 ); however,
we have recently found considerable amounts in the ascomy-
cetes Blastobotrys adeninivorans and Wickerhamomyces
anomalus (Olstorpe et al. 2014 ). In the present study, we
found detectable amounts of this fatty acid which were present
in both L. starkeyi and R. babjevae . The background and
physiological importance of the strong increase of C17:1 in
R. babjevae are not clear. Odd numbered fatty acids are pro-
duced by using propionyl-CoA in the initial step of fatty acidsynthesis (Tehlivets et al. 2007 ). Very recently, it has been
reported that the synthesis of C17:1 increased in yeasts, in-
cluding in the close relative to R. babjevae ,Rhodotorula
glutinis , when carbon sources with odd numbers of carbon
atoms were provided, compared to those with even numbers.
There was also a slight increase during growth on acetic acid(Rezanka et al. 2015 ). However, in our experiments, the con-
centration of carbon sources with odd numbers of carbon
atoms should be rather low, and also the amount of acetic acidwas much lower than that of glucose. Nevertheless, the in-
crease in C17:1 might open another interesting application
ofR. babjevae , since this fatty acid may have a variety of
applications in pharmacy or as antimicrobial agent (Rezanka
et al. 2015 ).
In both oleaginous yeasts studied, the linolenic acid
(C18:3) content increased when grown on hydrolysate.
L. starkeyi formed only C18:3 n-3 ( α-linolenic acid),
while R. babjevae formed both C18:3 n-3 and –n-6 (γ-
linolenic acid). Formation of linolenic acid (not specified
whether α-o rγ-linolenic acid) has been observed in L.
starkeyi as a response to low cultiv ation temperatures
( S u u t a r ie ta l . 1996 ). In R. glutinis , highest production
of linolenic acid has been observed under non-nitrogen
limiting conditions (i.e. under conditions where no lipid
was accumulated) or at lowered growth temperatures (25
vs. 30 °C) (Granger et al. 1992 ). Our experiments were
running at 30 °C, and the fact that the lipid content of thecells more than doubled during the cultivation argues
against a missing nitrogen limitation. Production of
C18:3 up to 5% of total fatty acids has been reportedforR. babjevae grown on glycerol (Munch et al. 2015 ).
Production of both α-a n d γ-linolenic acid was much
higher in strain R. babjevae DBVPG 8058 grown on the
residue of furfural production from wheat straw. When
producing biodiesel, a high degree of saturation is desir-
able, except when the diesel is made for utilisation in lowtemperatures (Knothe 2005 ). If the lipids are produced as
food or feed additives, polyuns aturated fatty acids such as
α-linolenic acid are often regarded advantageous (Das
2006 ). Further investigation is required to understand the
mechanisms regulating desaturation in oleaginous yeasts
when growing on lignocellulose hydrolysates.
Only few reports about lipid production in yeasts dif-
ferentiate between α-a n d γ-linolenic acid. Granger et al.
(1992 ) only reported α- linolenic acid, (Munch et al.
2015 ) did not differentiate between α-a n d γ-linolenic
acid production in R. babjevae .α-a n d γ-linolenic acid
have been observed in W. anomalus andB. adeninivorans
(Olstorpe et al. 2014 ), which are both not known as ole-
aginous yeasts. The mechan isms behind formation of α-
andγ-linolenic acid need further investigation. In exper-
iments with strain R. babjevae DBVPG 8058 and other
oleaginous yeasts, we found that the ability of R. babjevae
D B V P G8 0 5 8t of o r m γ-linolenic acid was quite unique
for this strain (unpublished results). γ-linolenic acid is
used as dietary food supplement and might influence in-flammatory responses (Sergeant et al. 2016 ), and thus, the
ability of this strain to produce γ-linolenic acid is of in-
terest for potential biotechnological applications.
This study demonstrates that the method of furfural
extraction developed at the Latvian State Institute of
Wood Chemistry indeed allows coproduction of furfuraland ethanol or lipids from wheat straw. Combined produc-
tion of furfural and ethanol has been calculated to be very
advantageous in terms of fossil oil replacement and green-house gas emission (Raman and Gnansounou 2015 ). Out
of 1 kg of wheat straw, apart from 110 g of furfural,
111 g of ethanol or 33 g of lipids (when using R.
babjevae
) could be produced. These additional products
can add value to the whole process, and either be used
as biofuels or as source of valuable chemicals, for in-stance, heptadecenoic acid, α- and γ-linolenic acid and
by these make the production of the platform chemical
furfural, which is solely derived from renewable, lignocel-lulosic matter, economically more attractive. Utilisation of
the remainder of the process as substrate for biogas pro-
duction, fertiliser, or as burning material to obtain processenergy may further increase the efficiency of the process
and reduce greenhouse gas emission and dependency on
fossil energy (Karlsson et al. 2016 , Karlsson et al. 2017 ).Appl Microbiol BiotechnolFunding information This work was supported by The Swedish
