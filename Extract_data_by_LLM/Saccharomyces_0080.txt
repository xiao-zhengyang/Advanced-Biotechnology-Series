 Primary sludge from a Portuguese pulp and paper mill, containing 60 % of 
carbohydrates, and unbleached pulp (as reference material), with 93% of carbohydrates, were used to produce et hanol by simultaneous saccharification and 
fermentation (SSF). SSF was performed in ba tch or fed-batch conditions without the 
need of a pretreatment. Cellic
® CTec2 was the cellulolytic enzymatic complex used and 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  (baker’s yeast or ATCC 26602 strain) or the thermotolerant 
yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus NCYC 1426 were employed. Primary sludge was 
successfully converted to ethanol and the best results in SSF efficiency were obtained with S. cerevisiae . An ethanol concentration of 22.7 g L
-1 was produced using a content 
of 50 g L-1 of carbohydrates from primary sludge, in batch conditions, with a global 
conversion yield of 81 % and a production rate of 0.94 g L-1 h-1. Fed-batch operation 
enabled higher solids content (total carbohydrate concentration of 200 g L-1, equivalent 
to a consistency of 33 %) and a reduction of three quarters of cellulolytic enzyme load, 
leading to an ethanol concentration of 40.7 g L-1, although with lower yield and 
productivity. Xylitol with a concentration up to 7 g L-1 was also identified as by-
product in the primary sludge bioconversion process.

Introduction 
The Portuguese pulp and paper industry generates nearly 350 000 tons of sludge per year.[1] 
This sludge is, in general, disposed of by incineration or landfill ing. Finding alternative 
solutions to manage this solid residue woul d decrease environmental and economic impacts 
[2]. Primary sludge, generated in the primary wastewater treatment, is rich in cellulosic fibres 
that can be valorised and used as feedstock to  produce a wide range of value-added products 
(e.g. second generation ethanol). For that purpose, this lignoc ellulosic residue becomes a 
potential raw-material, since it is readily available, abundant, re newable and has high 
carbohydrate and low lignin contents compared to natural lignocellulosi c materials.[3-5] Two 
important economic benefits are also associated  to the utilization of primary sludge: i) it has 
no purchase costs; and ii) the bi oconversion total cost is able to be reduced since the common 
4 
 stage of biomass pretreatment can be eliminate d. The fibres in the primary sludge are screen 
rejects of both the pulp and paper production. They are shor t, show a well-dispersed structure 
and thus have an easy enzymatic digestion.[5] However, primary sludge has also a high ash 
content (mostly calcium carbonate, CaCO 3) that can difficult its bioconversion. Wang et al. 
[6] reported that a significant CaCO 3 content was the key factor  affecting the enzymatic 
hydrolysis efficiency of paper based solid wa stes. This compound limits the solid loading 
capacity in the bioreactor and increases the pH  of sludge suspensions (7-10), thus affecting 
the enzymatic hydrolysis yield, catalysed by cellulases which have higher enzymatic activity when pH is near 5.[5, 6] For the bioconvers ion of lignocellulosic biomass by separate 
hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) or simultane ous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), 
many authors have reported the need for a pr etreatment, using an acid to neutralize CaCO
3 
and adjust pH before enzymatic hydrolysis.[5-9] In previous studies , a pretreatment was 
needed to remove CaCO 3 and adjust pH before enzymatic  hydrolysis, when primary sludge 
was converted to ethanol using a SHF configurat ion.[10] Other advanced strategies are also 
being studied, such as the uti lization of a consolidated biop rocessing system or the use of 
efficient engineered bacteria  instead of yeasts [11].  
The present work studies th e simultaneous saccharificati on and fermentation (SSF) of 
primary sludge to produce ethanol, without us ing a previous treatment. The SSF experiments 
were performed in batch and fed-batch conditions . The latter was used to increase the solids 
content in the bioreactor and, consequently, the ethanol concentration. The performances of a 
common and mesophilic industr ial-producing yeast strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae  (at 38 
ºC) and a thermotolerant yeast, Kluyveromyces marxianus NCYC 14226 (at 38 and 42 ºC) 
were compared.

 Methods 
Lignocellulosic Materials 
Primary sludge (PS) and unbleached pulp (UP) were provided by a local Portuguese kraft 
pulp mill which uses Eucalyptus globulus wood as raw-material. The lignocellulosic residue 
was collected from the primary wastewater clar ifier unit. Unbleached pulp has similar lignin 
content and lower ash content compared to pr imary sludge, and therefore it was used as a 
reference material. Moisture (and total solids), total ash and total lignin were analyzed 
according to the National Renewable Energy Labo ratory (NREL) standa rd procedures.[12] 
Total carbohydrates content wa s determined by difference. Calcium carbonate was calculated 
from the total ash content and the results obta ined by igniting a dry sample at 900 ºC. On a 
dry weight basis, primary sludge contained 4.8 % of total lignin, 34.8 % of ash and 60.4 % of 
total carbohydrates (CH). Unbleached pulp consisted of 2.1 % total lignin, 1.1 % ash and 93.4 % total carbohydrates. CaCO
3 was 26.7 % and 0.1 % in prim ary sludge and unbleached pulp, 
respectively. 
Enzymes and Microorganisms 
The enzymatic extract used in SSF assays, Cellic® CTec2, is a mixture of cellulases, β-
glucosidades and hemicellula ses and it was a kind gift fr om Novozymes. The corresponding 
cellulase activity was 200.7 FPU mL-1 (filter paper assay), as measured according to the 
NREL standard procedure [12], at pH 5.0 and 50 ºC (optimal pH and temperature values). 
The enzymatic activity determined at 38 and 42 ºC was 45 and 59 FPU mL-1. 
Baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, provided by a local wine producer, and 
Kluyveromyces marxianus NCYC 1426, acquired from the National Collection of Yeast 
Cultures (NCYC, Britain) were the mi croorganisms employed. Another strain, 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 26602 (American Type Cultu re Collection, Virginia, USA)  
6 
 was also used in some assays. Optimal pH and temperature for S. cerevisiae  is 4.5-5.5 and 30 
ºC, respectively. Accordi ng to the producer, optimal and ma ximum temperature for growth of 
K. marxianus  NCYC 1426 is 40 and 42 °C, respec tively, and optimal pH is 4.5-5.0. The 
yeasts were kept in agar slants, wi th the Yeast Medium (YM) plus 15 g L-1 agar (HiMedia 
Laboratories), at 4 °C.  The YM consisted of 3 g L-1 yeast extract, 3 g L-1 malt extract, 5 g L-1 
peptone (all from Fluka) and 10 g L-1 glucose (Riedel de-Haën).  
Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) 
All SSF experiments were performed in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Batch and fed-batch SSF 
were performed with S. cerevisiae at 38 ºC and K. marxianus  NCYC 1426 at 38 or 42 ºC. A 
fresh yeast inoculum amount of 10 % of total working volume (100 mL) was added, together 
with an enzyme loading of 35 FPU g CH-1 (concerning the carbohydrat e content added at t=0 
h) and a supplement of 3 g L-1 yeast extract, 3 g L-1 malt extract, 5 g L-1 peptone and 5 g L-1 
of glucose. In batch SSF, primary sludge or unbleached pulp suspended in 0.05 M citrate 
buffer was added such that the total carbohydrat es content (in their polymeric form) in the 
bioreactor was c.a 25 or 50 g L-1. In fed-batch conditions, prim ary sludge or unbleached pulp 
was loaded in the flasks periodically (4 tim es at t=0 h and every 24 h), each time with the 
amount of 25 or 50 g L-1 of carbohydrates. Therefore, a total of 100 or 200 g L-1 of 
carbohydrates were added, respectively. SSF experi ments were carried ou t at 150 rpm in the 
orbital shaker (Stuart SI50, UK). Samples we re withdrawn from SSF culture broth and 
centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min (Hettich, Germany). The first samples in the assays with 50 g L
-1 of carbohydrates were withdrawn only after 3 h of reaction, when initial liquefaction 
of solid substrates was observed. Fermentation controls (without li gnocellulosic material) 
were also performed in order to eliminate th e contribution of external sugars (from the 
enzyme, glucose and extracts solutio ns) in the production of ethanol.

 Analytical Methods for SSF Samples 
Samples from SSF experiments were analysed for pH, sugars, ethanol and by-products. 
Reducing sugars were determined by the colo rimetric DNS method.[13] Individual sugars, 
ethanol and by-products were evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
after the samples were filtrated  with a 0.2 µm syringe filter membrane (Whatman). HPLC 
system consisted of a Knauer model K-301 with a refractive inde x (RI) detector. The 
components were analysed with an Agilent Hi -Plex Ca (8 µm × 300 mm) column maintained 
at 80-85 ºC. The eluent used  was ultra-pure water at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min-1, previously 
filtered with a 0.2 µm filter membrane and dega ssed. Ethanol yield (Y) was calculated by Eq. 
(1), were: [EtOH] t is the ethanol concentration (g EtOH L-1) at time t (h); 0.51 is the mass 
conversion factor of sugar to ethanol (g EtOH gsug-1); f is the fraction of  carbohydrates in dry 
weight lignocellulosic biomass (dwb) (g CH gdwb-1); [Biomass] is the concentration of dry 
weight lignocellulosic biomass, initial in batc h operation and total added until the time of 
ethanol evaluation, for fed-batch operation (g dwb L-1); and 1.1 is the global mass conversion 
of carbohydrates to monomeric sugars (g sug gCH-1). Ethanol productivity (P) was determined 
according to Eq. (2).[12,14]    
 Y (%) = [EtOH]t 
0.51 × (f × [Biomass] × 1.1)×100 (1)

Results and Discussion 
SSF in Batch Conditions  
Table 1 shows the results of maximum ethanol  concentration produced by baker’s yeast S. 
cerevisiae or K. marxianus  NCYC 1426 in the SSF of prim ary sludge or unbleached pulp in 
8 
 batch conditions [Table 1 near here].  In the SSF of unbleached pulp, the ethanol 
concentration and productivity in creased with the ini tial carbohydrate content, whilst ethanol 
yield decreased. When primary sludge was us ed, all SSF parameters increased when the 
initial carbohydrate content was increased. For the higher ini tial carbohydrate content (50 g 
L-1, corresponding to a primary sludge consistenc y of 8.3 %), an ethanol concentration of 
22.7 g L-1 was obtained from primary sludge, sligh tly higher than the one produced from 
unbleached pulp (20.8 g L-1). The conversion yield of carbohydr ates from primary sludge into 
ethanol was 80.6 % and ethanol was obtained with a production rate of 0.94 g L-1 h-1. In the 
case of the reference material, ethanol yi eld and productivity were 74.3 % and 0.87 g L-1 h-1. 
Figure 1 compares the profiles of glucose, xylos e and ethanol concentrations obtained in the 
SSF of the two lignocellulosic materials (50 g L-1 of carbohydrates), when S. cerevisiae was 
used [Figure 1 near here]. For the first hours of  SSF (at least 6 h), the enzymatic hydrolysis of 
the carbohydrates was the prevailing process, producing glucose and xylose (more evident in 
Figure 1a). The rate of conversion of carbohydrates to monomeric sugars by Cellic® CTec2 
was higher than the rate of sugars consumption by S. cerevisiae. Therefore, fermentable 
sugars were accumulated in the SSF culture brot h and low levels of ethanol were produced. 
During this period of time, the liquefaction of the initial mixture was well visible. With the 
increase of the solids charge, more time was n eeded for the mixture to liquefy. Between 6 and 
24 h of SSF, glucose was sharply consumed and ethanol was produced. Other authors had 
observed similar behaviours.[4,14]   After reaching its maximum value, ethanol concentration 
remained constant till the e nd of the SSF of unbleached pulp (Figure 1a) and it slightly 
decreased in the SSF of primar y sludge (Figure 1b). The results obtained in the SSF of 
untreated primary sludge (or unbleached pulp) with baker’s yeast S. cerevisiae in this work 
compares well with the ones obtained by Kang et al. [5], using S. cerevisiae ATCC 200062 
(SSF performed at 37 ºC with 15 FPU of cellulase Spezyme CP and 30 CBU of glucosidase 
9 
 Novozym 188 per gram of glucan). These auth ors obtained an ethanol concentration of 13.6 g 
L-1 from 3 % glucan loading, either in the SSF of untreated primary sludge (with an ash 
content up to 36 %) or hardwood pulp, with appr oximately 80 % of conversion yield. When 
glucan loading was increased to 6 %,  an ethanol concentration of 25.5 g L-1 was achieved, 
reaching 75 % of the maximum theoretical yield.  In other study where paper sludge was used 
as raw-material for bioethanol production wi thout any pretreatment , Dwiarti et al. [15] 
obtained 11.8 g L-1 of ethanol from 50 g L-1 of paper sludge, with a conversion yield of 80 % 
based on consumed glucose.  
The profiles for the SSF of 50 g L-1 of carbohydrates from unbleached pulp or 
primary sludge, with K. marxianus  NCYC 1426, at 38 or 42 ºC, are showed in Figure 2 
[Figure 2 near here]. In the SSF of unbleached  pulp, ethanol concentration and yield were 
improved with the increase of temperatur e (38 to 42 ºC). In the SSF of 50 g L-1 of 
carbohydrates of unbleached pulp at 38 ºC (Table 1), an ethanol  concentration of 15.2 g L-1 
was produced (yield of 54.6 % and productivity of 2.53 g L-1 h-1), compared to 16.5 g L-1 of 
ethanol achieved at 42 ºC (yield of 58.8 % and productivity of 2.75 g L-1 h-1). In the SSF of 
primary sludge, the increase of temperature did not improve the process performance. The 
carbohydrates (50 g L-1) from primary sludge were converted to 20.7 g L-1 of ethanol at 38 ºC 
(yield of 73.7 % and productivity of 0.86 g L-1 h-1) and 15.1 g L-1 at 42 ºC (yield of 53.7 % 
and productivity of 0.63 g L-1 h-1). Similar results on ethanol  production were obtained by 
Ballesteros et al. [16], reporting values in the range of 16.2-19 g L-1 in the SSF of different 
steam explosion pretreated lignocellulosic subs trates (10 % substrate concentration), using K. 
marxianus  CECT 10875 and 15 FPU of Celluclast 1.5L per gram of substrate, at 42 ºC.  
In the present work, K. marxianus  NCYC 1426 produced lower ethanol 
concentrations than S. cerevisiae, generally with lower convers ion yields, in the same SSF 
conditions (Table 1). In the l iterature it can be found similar or different observations. For 
10 
 instance, Faga et al. [14] compared five Kluyveromyces marxianus IMB thermotolerant yeast 
strains and S. cerevisiae D5A in the SSF of hydrothermolys is pretreated switchgrass, under 
different conditions. The authors reported that ethanol yield for S. cerevisiae  D5A was 
greater than all of the K. marxianus  IMB strains, except one whic h showed similar results. On 
the other hand, Kádár et al. [4] observed no significant differences between K. marxianus  
Y01070 and baker’s yeast S. cerevisiae  in the batch SSF of paper sl udge, carried out at 40 ºC, 
with 15 FPU of cellulase and 15 IU of Novozym 188 per gram  of dry substrate. Ethanol 
concentrations of 8.8-9 g L-1 with conversion yields of 58-60 % were obtained in the SSF of 6 
% of paper sludge. 
It should be highlighted that  the SSF experiments were carri ed out in the present study 
with success without the need of the sludge pretreatment to remove CaCO 3, or to adjust the 
alkaline sludge pH. However, the ethanol c oncentration is low for an economic separation. 
To increase ethanol concentr ation in the fermentation brot h, higher carbohydrate contents 
must be used in the process. A maximum value of 8.3 % was here used for the solids content. 
However, the increase of substrate concentr ation may decrease ethanol yields.[9,17,18] Many 
authors have employed initial substr ate concentrations up to 7.5 % in SSF 
configurations.[4,5,8,16] High solids consistency in batch systems causes mixing and heat 
transfer difficulties and/or e nd-products inhibition effects. Si nce high amounts of fermentable 
sugars are needed to produce high ethanol c oncentrations, a high amount of primary sludge 
would have to be added in the assay. Howe ver, mixing difficulties would be observed. To 
overcome such problems, fed-batch can be appl ied to maintain low solid levels, but still 
increasing the sugars available for ethanol production.[17,19-22] 
SSF in Fed-Batch Conditions  
The application of fed-batch conditions was test ed with the two lignocellulosic materials in 
11 
 order to increase the amount of total availabl e carbohydrates and consequently to increase the 
ethanol concentration. In addi tion, this operation mode enable d a reduction of 75 % of the 
enzymatic load, compared to the above describe d batch operation. The resu lts obtained in the 
SSF of unbleached pulp or primary sludge in fed- batch conditions are showed in Table 2. 
Two different total concentrations of carbohydrates were tested (100 and 200 g L-1, gradually 
added). The assays started w ith an initial carbohy drate concentration and when the mix 
became more fluid (after partia l saccharification) more primar y sludge was added to reach the 
final carbohydrate concentrations . As observed in Table 2, the strategy was efficient for 
ethanol concentration increase [T able 2 near here]. However th e conversion yield was lower, 
indicating that i) a significant amount of carbohydrates were not hydrolysed to fermentable 
sugars, ii) the fermentable sugars were not meta bolized by yeast or iii) the fermentable sugars 
were not used to ethanol production pathway. Fi gure 3 shows that xylose was produced from 
the eucalyptus hemicelluloses but was not si gnificantly consumed, remaining essentially 
constant during the process [Figure 3 near here ]. In contrast, glucose was totally consumed. 
Figure 3 also shows the similarity of glucose,  xylose and ethanol profiles between the SSF of 
unbleached pulp and primary sludge (same amount of total carbohydrates, 200 g L-1). It can 
be observed that is redundant  to extend a SSF process beyon d 75 h of reaction, using the 
conditions described in this work. An ethanol concentration of 45.6 g L-1 was achieved, when 
a total of 200 g L-1 of carbohydrates was gradually added in the SSF of unbleached pulp with 
S. cerevisiae  (Table 2). The ethanol was pr oduced with a rate of 0.63 g h-1 L-1 and the 
conversion yield was 52.9 %. In the SSF of  primary sludge good results in ethanol 
concentration was also achieved (40.7 g L-1). An ethanol yield and productivity of 32.4 % and 
0.52 g h-1 L-1 were determined, respectively. The tota l solids load based on dry primary 
sludge was 33 %. 
12 
 As also showed in Table 2, the baker’s yeast S. cerevisiae had similar performance to 
that of S. cerevisiae ATCC 26602 strain in the fed-batc h SSF of primary sludge, concerning 
to ethanol concentration and productivity, confirming the reliability  of its use.   
In comparison with the batch operation, Kang et  al. [5] reported the same pattern, that 
is, a lower ethanol yield in the fed-batch SSF of primary sludge. This result was related to the 
cellulase reaction, mainly affected by the high so lid content in the bioreactor. These authors 
carried out fed-batch SSF runs with untreat ed kraft paper mill sludge, performing two 
additional feedings (a total of 18 % glucan lo ading). A final ethanol concentration of 45 g L-1 
was produced with a conversion yield of 70 % (based on glucan), although requiring a longer 
reaction time (120 h). Prasetyo et  al. [22] also produced etha nol from primary sludge by SSF 
without any pretreatment, in batch or fed-batch operati on. The author reported mixing 
problems caused by high paper sludge concentrations (> 110 g L-1 based on organic material). 
In fed-batch mode, an ethanol concentration of 40 g L-1 was obtained after 72 h, with a 
conversion yield of 23 % for paper sl udge concentrations up to 160 g L-1 (added in portions). 
In the present work, a higher ethanol yield was achieved.  
As depicted in Table 2, the ethanol concen trations obtained in the SSF assays with K. 
marxianus  NCYC 1426 were lower than  the ones achieved with S. cerevisiae . Despite of 
being known for its thermotolerance, the use of that yeast at a higher temperature (increased 
from 38 to 42 ºC) did not lead to a better effici ency. In general, and as observed in Figure 4, a 
high amount of glucose remained, as non-consumed, indicating that yeast metabolism was somehow inhibited [Figure 4 near here]. It was observed that, either using S. cerevisiae or K. 
marxianus  NCYC 1426, the last ca rbohydrate amount added had a very small effect on 
ethanol concentration, surely lowering the ethanol yield.  
Ballesteros et al. [19] used a recycled paper-derived feedstock to produce ethanol by 
SSF with K. marxianus  CECT 10875 at 42 ºC, in batch or fed-batch, testing several substrate 
13 
 concentrations and enzyme loadings. A maximu m value of 10 % was used for substrate load 
in fed-batch operation, leading to an  ethanol concentration of 17.7 g L-1 with a conversion 
yield of 79.7 %, higher than  the results obtained with K. marxianus  NCYC 1426 in the 
present work. 
pH and By-products  
The pH of primary sludge suspensions is around 8. Its alkalinity is due to CaCO 3 presence. In 
SSF of primary sludge (batch or fed-batch), pH value decreased from nearly 8.1 to 5.8 during 
the process. During ethanolic fermentation proc esses, pH gradually decreases due to the 
formation of carbonic acid and othe r organic acids, such as acetic  acid. Therefore, in SSF of 
untreated primary sludge, the existing CaCO 3 can be partially neutralized by the acids 
formed, acting afterwards as a buffer to stabilize pH, promoting carbohydrates conversion to 
fermentable sugars [5]. In SSF of unbleached pul p, small pH variations were registered (5.3 – 
4.4). Cellobiose, acetic acid or glycerol were detected and quantified by HPLC during the SSF assays. The concentration of these by-produ cts varied, depending on the SSF conditions. 
In the SSF assays with S. cerevisiae (which showed better results ), maximum concentrations 
of 6.5, 0.6 and 4.8 g L
-1 of cellobiose, glycerol and acetic acid, respectively, were observed in 
batch conditions. In fed-batch SSF with the same yeast, 7.4 g L-1 of cellobiose and 11.0 g L-1 
of acetic acid were produced, with no traces  of glycerol. The higher amount of fermentable 
sugars metabolized in fed-batch SSF has led to higher by-products concentrations, such as the 
one of acetic acid. Xylitol produc tion was also observed in batc h or fed-batch SSF, whether 
the yeast used was S. cerevisiae  or K. marxianus NCYC 1426. Xylitol co ncentration in the 
SSF varied between 5.0 and 7.0 g L-1. S. cerevisiae  had been shown that is unable to ferment 
pentoses, namely xylose. However, it was reported that S. cerevisiae is able to reduce xylose 
into xylitol in the pres ence of co-substrates, such as glucose or ethanol.[23,24] In fact,

 parallel studies were conducted in this work to confirm the production of xylitol, as well as 
ethanol, in the presence of a sugar mixture and S. cerevisiae. The yeast was grown in 50 g L-1 
of glucose, producing an etha nol concentration of 20 g L-1. No xylitol was detected in the 
broth culture. When it was grown in 50 g L-1 of xylose, no ethanol was produced and 4 g L-1 
of xylitol was obtained. At the end of fermentation, a xylose concentration of 44 g L-1 
remained unused. In a medium consisted of 40 g L-1 of glucose and 10 g L-1 of xylose, S. 
cerevisiae produced nearly 17 g L-1 of ethanol and a xylitol  concentration of 10 g L-1 was 
quantified. At the end of fermentation no glucos e or xylose was detected (data not shown). 
Conclusions  
Primary sludge from Portuguese pulp and paper mills without any previous treatment can be 
converted into value-added products, such as ethanol, by SSF. S. cerevisiae  (baker’s yeast 
and ATCC 26602 strain) showed a better pe rformance than the thermotolerant K. marxianus 
NCYC 1426. For batch operation, 22.7 g L-1 of ethanol was obtained with a carbohydrates-to-
ethanol conversion yield of 81 %, using 50 g L-1 of carbohydrates. Fed-batch operation 
enabled high solids content (reaching a primar y sludge consistency of 33 %) and a reduction 
of 75 % of cellulolytic enzyme load. Et hanol concentration was improved (40.7 g L-1), 
although with a decrease of the yield (32 %).  Xylitol with a concentration up to 7 g L-1 was 
also identified as by-product in the primary sludge bioc onversion process.
