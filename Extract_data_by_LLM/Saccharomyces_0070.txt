Neutralizer-free bioproduction ABSTRACT  
In industrial bioproduction of organic acids, numerous neutralizers are required which substantially increases 
production costs and burdens the environment. To address this challenge, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant 
(named TAMC) with a low pH tolerance (pH 2.3) was isolated by adaptive laboratory evolution. Taking the 
synthesis of L-malic acid as an example, the malate dehydrogenase 3 without signal peptide (MDH ΔSKL) and 
pyruvate carboxylase 2 (PYC2) were overexpressed in cytoplasmic synthesis pathway, and the L-malic acid titer 
increased 5.6-fold. Subsequently, the malic acid transporter SpMae1 was designed, and the extracellular L-malic 
acid titer was increased from 7.3 to 73.6 g/L. Furthermore, by optimizing the synthesis of the precursor pyruvate, 
the titer reached 81.8 g/L. Finally, without any neutralizer, the titer in the 3-L bioreactor reached 232.9 g/L, the 
highest L-malic acid titer reported to date. Herein, the engineered L-malic acid overproducer paves the way for 
the large-scale green production of L-malic acid.

21.Introduction 
As an important chemical raw material, organic acid has been widely 
used in the biomedicine, food additives, and material industries (Liu 
et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2017b). Recently, using microbial fermentation to 
produce organic acids has been regarded as a promising approach. 
However, during the bioproduction of organic acids, the pH decreases 
markedly due to the overproduction of their own acidic products, which 
severely inhibits the metabolic activity of cells and the production ef-
ficiency (Ullah et al., 2012). Currently, the main strategy for addressing 
this key issue is to add neutralizers (calcium carbonate [CaCO 3], mag-
nesium carbonate [MgCO 3], sodium hydroxide [NaOH], or ammonium 
hydroxide [NH 3⋅H2O]), which not only complicates the downstream 
purification process but also pollutes the environment (Chen et al., 
2016; Chen & Nielsen, 2016). For example, to produce 59.0 g/L malate 
by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 150.0 g/L CaCO 3 was used (Zelle et al., 
2008). Moreover, the production of 40 g/L fumaric acid by Aspergillus 
oryzae fermentation required the addition of more than 40.0 g/L CaCO 3 
(Papadaki et al., 2018). These processes are common during the mi-
crobial production of other organic acids as well (Baek et al., 2016; He 
et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2015; Marinho et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2013). 
Therefore, enhancing the tolerance of microorganisms to low pH to 
avoid the use of neutralizers is essential to achieve large-scale green 
production of organic acids. 
According to previous studies, many microorganisms have been used 
to synthesize organic acids, including S. cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, 
Aspergillus flavus, A. oryzae, and Rhizopus delemar (Liu et al., 2017b; Yin 
et al., 2015). Among them, S. cerevisiae is the main microbial chassis for 
bioproduction owing to its short growth cycle, high fermentation ability, 
and good large-scale performance (Cravens et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; 
Zhang et al., 2022). In yeast, the pathways to synthesize L-malic acid 
include cytoplasmic pathway, mitochondrial pathway (TCA cycle), 
cyclic-glyoxylate cycle, and noncyclic-glyoxylate cycle (Brown et al., 
2013). The highest synthesis rate of L-malic acid was cytoplasmic 
pathway. In the above pathway, two key enzymes contribute to the 
synthesis of L-malic acid: pyruvate carboxylase 2 (PYC2) and malate 
dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2). However, MDH2 is inactivated by glucose 
catabolism in the cytoplasm, which largely limits L-malic acid synthesis 
(Zelle et al., 2008). Therefore, it is important to obtain the MDH2 
isoenzyme to alleviate inhibition of glucose for L-malic acid synthesis in 
S. cerevisiae. In addition, it was previously reported that the transport 
rate of L-malic acid through the plasma membrane was very low in 
S. cerevisiae (Volschenk et al., 2003). Therefore, improving the transport 
efficiency of L-malic acid transporter is critical to the efficient synthesis 
of L-malic acid by S. cerevisiae. 
Recently, the acid resistance of microorganisms has been studied and 
several strategies have been revealed. Based on the characteristics of 
adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) method with strong selection 
pressure, the target strains can be acquired more efficiently (Pereira 
et al., 2020; Sandberg et al., 2014). The ALE has been an indispensable 
tool to explore microorganism adaptation to a specific environment. For 
example, through ALE, Pereira et al. obtained a strain that could tolerate 
aromatic acids (pH 3.5), and the evaluation of the acid tolerance 
mechanism revealed that the overexpression of the aromatic acid 
transporter ESBP6 was the key factor for the improved tolerance to low 
pH (Pereira et al., 2020). In addition, the proton pump (Fernandes & Sa- 
Correia, 2003; Hou et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2017) or other ATP-binding 
cassette transporters (Godinho et al., 2018; Nygard et al., 2014) were 
involved in the regulation of acid tolerance; however, they could only 
improve microorganism tolerance to weak acids (pH 4.0–5.8). However, 
in the industrial bioproduction process, the fermentation medium pH is 
often lower than 3.0. These low pH environments typically induce 
oxidative stress of cells to produce multitudinous reactive oxygen spe-
cies, which have fatal toxicity to cells (Imlay, 2013; Tomanek, 2015). 
Therefore, the current acid tolerance of yeast is insufficient to meet the 
preferred bioproduction requirements. Table 1

3This study aimed to utilize ALE to isolate an acid-resistant mutant to 
enhance the tolerance of microorganisms to low pH. The stability of the 
mutant for stable generation and broad-spectrum acid tolerance was 
analyzed. The application of the mutant was verified in terms of its 
ability to efficiently synthesize L-malic acid at low pH without adding 
nonrenewable, environmentally detrimental neutralizers. The use of an 
acid-responsive regulatory system to optimize transporters and improve 
the precursor pyruvate for efficient synthesis was explored. These pro-
cesses were incorporated to construct a highly efficient organic acid- 
producing cell factory, which would lay the foundation for future in-
dustrial development of bio-based acid products for neutralizer-free 
sustainable green bioproduction. 
2.Material and methods 
2.1. Strains and culture conditions. 
The wild-type (WT) yeast used was S. cerevisiae CEN.PK2-1C (Lab 
stock), while the acid-tolerant S. cerevisiae (produced in this study) is 
referred to as TAMC. TAMC was used as the host for the construction of 
L-malic acid bioproduction strains. The medium yeast extract peptone 
dextrose (YPD) was used for the cultivation of S. cerevisiae . The culture 
conditions were an agitation rate of 220 rpm and a temperature of 30 •C. 
In the process of laboratory evolution screening and cultivation, L-malic 
acid and citric acid were used as stressors. As previously reported by this 
laboratory, using synthetic dropout (SD) agar plates with auxotroph 
markers selected the transformants strains (Xu et al., 2022 ). All strains 
and plasmids were listed in Table 1. 
2.2. ALE screening 
The WT strain was selected for the ALE, and the process was divided 
into two stages. L-malic acid was used as the selection pressure in the 
first stage. Direct evolution screening resulted in a lower pH-tolerant 
mutant strain of S. cerevisiae . During the evolution process, the growth 
of each replica was monitored regularly. The acid concentration was 
slowly increased at each pH until the growth was stable and the pH was 
gradually decreased. By adding different malic acid concentrations, the 
pH was decreased in a step-wise controlled manner (starting from pH 
6.0, the addition amount of exogenous malic acid was 4.6 g/L). After 
cells at each pH level had evolved to be able to grow in those conditions, 
they were cultured in parallel for enrichment and proceeded to the next 
pH level decrease. For example, the process of decrease in pH from the 
initial pH of 6.0 to 4.0 was divided into 10 spans, and each span was a 
decrease in pH by 0.2; from pH 4.0 to 3.5, it was divided into five spans, 
and each span was a decrease in pH by 0.1; from pH 3.5 to 3.0, each span 
was a decrease in pH by 0.05; from pH 3.0 to 2.8, each span was a 
decrease in pH by 0.02; and finally, at pH D2.8, the pH span of each 
level was a decrease in pH by 0.01. 
S. cerevisiae TAMC was obtained after 810 continuous generations, 
and it could tolerate 86.6 g/L L-malic acid (maximum solubility is 100 g/ 
L) in a culture medium of pH 2.4. In the second stage, TAMC continued 
to be acclimatized with citric acid as the selection pressure. After 1710 
generations, S. cerevisiae TAMC could tolerate 29.5 g/L citric acid at pH 
2.3. 
2.3. Growth assay 
The growth of the evolution mutants and engineered strains were 
assayed in 250-mL shake flasks with 50 mL culture, an agitation rate of 
220 rpm, a temperature of 30 •C, and an initial optical density (OD) 600 of 
0.08. Anaerobic incubation flasks were used for cultivation under 
anaerobic conditions, and cell densities were monitored by measuring 
the OD600. The pH was adjusted with L-malic acid and citric acid as 
needed. 2.4. Colony spot assay 
For the spot assay, the cells were cultured in YPD medium to mid-log 
phase at pH 2.3 or 7.0 at 30 •C. A tenfold continuously diluted cell 
suspension was prepared for spot assay. 
2.5. Construction and expression of key genes 
All primers were designed based on the S. cerevisiae S288C genome 
sequence (see supplementary material s). The genes encoding malate 
dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2), malate dehydrogenase 3 (MDH3), malate 
dehydrogenase 3 without signal peptide (MDH3 ΔSKL), pyruvate 
carboxylase 2 (PYC2), pyruvate kinase (PYK), and cytochrome b2 
(CYB2) were cloned from the S. cerevisiae S288C. In addition, the 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe malate transporter SpMae1 and mutants 
were used to mediate the export of L-malic acid. All modifications were 
integrated into the genome using amino acids (uracil, tryptophan, his-
tidine, and leucine) as screening tags. DNA manipulation and trans -
formation was performed as previously reported (Shao et al., 2009 ). 
Promoters and integration sites in this study were selected based on 
previous work (Reider et al., 2017 ). 
2.6. MDH activity assays 
The four strains TAMC, TAMC-A01, TAMC-A02, and TAMC-A03 
were centrifuged in the mid-log phase and 200 µL of extract (BC1045, 
Solarbio Science & Technology) was added (for every 1000,000 cells). 
The cells were disrupted by sonication (power, 20 %; ultrasonic wave, 3 
s; interval, 10 s; repetition, 30 times) and centrifuged at 8000 ×g (10 
min, 4 •C). NAD-MDH catalyzes the reduction of oxaloacetic acid by 
NADH to generate L-malic acid, resulting in the change of absorption at 
340 nm. The kit manufacturer ’s protocol was used to measure the 
enzyme activity of MDH (BC1045, Solarbio Science & Technology). In 
addition, the U (unit) is 1 nmol of NADH per minute consumed by every 
10,000 cells in the reaction system and is defined as an enzyme activity 
unit. 
2.7. Structural prediction of SpMae1 
The AlphaFold2 prediction software was used to generate the tertiary 
structure of SpMae1 and the PyMoL software was used for visualization 
analysis (Liu et al., 2022 ). The channel was completed using the CAVER 
3.0 software, and the substrate channel of SpMae1 was predicted from 
the catalytic center. 
2.8. High-throughput screening of SpMae1 mutagenesis library 
The SpMae1 mutant libraries were constructed using error-prone 
PCR (Takara Bio) to obtain random mutagenesis in the transporters 
(Nasu et al., 2021 ). Subsequently, the above saturated mutants were 
introduced into the strain TAMC-B7 (carrying the L-malic acid response 
system) to construct the TAMC-B8 strain with the mutant library of 
transporter SpMae1 for sorting via flow cytometry. A total of 2000 
strains with a fluorescence intensity lower than 1000 were screened and 
cultured in 96-well black plates with shaking for 36 h (30 •C, 1000 rpm). 
The fluorescence (Ex 490 nm; Em 528 nm) was directly detected 
using a microplate reader (BioTek). Next, 192 strains with a fluores -
cence intensity that met the screening requirements were selected for re- 
screening verification in 96-well black plates. 
Based on the data of microplate reader measurement, the 15 mutant 
strain with the lower fluorescence density were identified from the 
SpMae1 mutant library, which were named SpMae1-m1, SpMae1-m2, 
SpMae1-m3, SpMae1-m4, SpMae1-m5, SpMae1-m6, SpMae1-m7, 
SpMae1-m8, SpMae1-m9, SpMae1-m10, SpMae1-m11, SpMae1-m12, 
SpMae1-m13, SpMae1-m14, and SpMae1-m15. These above strains 
were also verified via shaking flask fermentation, and L-malic acid L. Sun et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 128580
4concentration in the cell precipitation and fermentation broth were 
determined. SpMae1 genes of the strains with the most obvious increase 
in L-malic acid concentration in the SpMae1 mutant library were 
sequenced. Subsequently, the SpMae1 mutant (F253 mutants) was 
introduced into the TAMC-A5 to generate the engineering strains, which 
were then cultured in a shake flask for L-malic acid production. 
2.9. Shake flask cultivation 
Seed culture was performed in 5-mL culture tubes containing 2 mL of 
YPD broth with shacking for 28 h (30 •C, 220 rpm). L-malic acid pro-
duction tests were performed in 250-mL shake flasks containing 30 mL 
of the medium (10 g yeast extract, 120 g glucose, 30 g soy peptone, 2 g 
sodium glutamate, 15 g (NH4) 2SO4, 0.72 g ZnSO 4⋅7H2O, 8 g KH2PO4, 
0.15 g methionine, and 6 g MgSO 4⋅7H2O, per 1 L), with 3 % (v/v) seed 
culture. Cultures were inoculated at an initial OD600 of 0.08 with 
shaking at 220 rpm in an orbital incubator (30 •C, 120 h). The engineered strains were cultured in the orbital incubator with an initial 
OD600 of 0.08 by shaking at 220 rpm (30 •C, 120 h). 
2.10. Fed-batch culture in a 3-L bioreactor 
The preparation of fermentation medium for fed batch culture is 
consistent with that of shake flask medium, except for the initial sugar 
concentration (60 g/L glucose). 
In addition, vitamin solution and trace metal solution were added in 
fermentation medium (Westfall et al., 2012 ). Seed culture was con-
ducted in 500-mL flasks containing 100 mL YPD medium and incubated 
for 36 h (30 •C, 220 rpm). 
The seed culture was inoculated into a 3-L fermenter (T&J Bio- 
engineering (Shanghai) Co., ltd) with an initial 1.1 L of fermentation 
medium. The range of agitation rates were 700 ~ 800 rpm, and the 
aeration was 1.5 v/v/m. In addition, the pH was not controlled, and the 
temperature was 30 •C. The sugar concentration for feeding was 600 g/

5L. To verify whether low pH affects the production performance of the L- 
malic acid, the strain TAMC-A10 was also cultured in 3-L fermenter with 
constant pH 6.5 by adding neutralizer CaCO 3, and other conditions were 
the same as the above fermentation (without neutralizer). 
2.11. Metabolite analysis 
The L-malic acid titer was measured via high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) as previously studied by this laboratory (Liu 
et al., 2018 ). Approximately 1.5 mL of the fermentation liquid was 
centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15–20 min, and the supernatant was 
collected to measure the extracellular L-malic acid concentration using 
HPLC. When detecting the intracellular concentration, the above 
centrifuged cell precipitation was used for ultrasonic crushing (the total 
volume of ultrasonic crushing solution is equivalent to the volume of the 
fermentation liquid), and the content of L-malic acid was measured by 
HPLC. 
2.12. Statistical analysis 
GraphPad Prism9 (version 9.0.0, San Diego, CA, USA) and OriginPro 
2022 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA) were used for statistical an-
alyses. All experiments were repeated three independent replicates. Statistical significance is indicated as *(p D0.05), **(p D0.01), and *** 
(p D0.001). 
3.Results and discussion 
3.1. ALE to improve acid tolerance of S. Cerevisiae 
To obtain an S. cerevisiae strain with tolerance to extremely low pH, 
L-malic acid and citric acid were used as selective pressures for ALE, 
because they have high industrial value, wide application, and better 
solubility. The native tolerance of S. cerevisiae CEN.PK2-1C (WT) to 
organic acids was examined. Results showed that growth inhibition 
began when the pH of the medium was D6.0 (Fig. 1A). Next, the ALE 
process was divided into two stages (Fig. 1B and C), with the selective 
pressure of L-malic acid used in the first stage (pH reduction from 6.0 to 
2.4, with 86.6 g/L L-malic acid) and citric acid used in the second stage 
(pH reduction from 2.4 to 2.3, with 29.5 g/L citric acid) to obtain the 
strain TAMC (mutant with a pH tolerance of 2.3). Compared with the 
WT, the colony-forming units of the TAMC at pH 2.3 increased by 
104–105 times (Fig. 1D and E). Compared with previous reports (Guar-
agnella & Bettiga, 2021; Kildegaard et al., 2014 ), the pH of 2.3 tolerated 
by the TAMC strain is the lowest pH reportedly tolerated by S. cerevisiae 
to date. 
Fig. 2.Effects of pH and different organic acids on growth. Fifteen acids were selected, including hydrochloric, phosphoric, pyruvic, fumaric, citric, L-malic, glu-
conic, muconic, formic, itaconic, L-lactic, succinic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic, acetic, and propionic acids. For each organic acid, five different concentrations (0, 100, 
200, 400, and 800 mM) were used for acid tolerance analysis. The TAMC strain showed different degrees of tolerance to test acids. The pH corresponding to the 
tolerance concentration of fumaric acid, gluconic acid, muconic acid, itaconic acid, L-lactic acid, succinic acid, and propionic acid are 2.8, 2.5, 2.6, 3.2, 2.5, 3.0, 3.2, 
respectively. L. Sun et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 128580
63.2. Analysis of the acid tolerance stability of the TAMC strain and its 
resistance to various acids 
To analyze the acid tolerance stability of the TAMC strain, the strain 
was cultured for 100 consecutive generations at pH 2.3 and found that it 
had stable acid resistance. The culture of evolutionary clones of each 
acid was analyzed by HPLC to determine whether the evolutionary 
phenotype relied on the degradation of the acids. As shown in (see 
supplementary material s), with the addition of 86.6 g/L L-malic acid and 
29.5 g/L citric acid in the culture medium, the remaining L-malic acid 
and citric acid concentration were stable at 85.4 g/L (p 0.36) and 29.0 
g/L (p 0.45), respectively after 120 h of fermentation. This indicates 
that the evolved trait of the TAMC strain depended on physiological 
adaptation to tolerate acids, rather than acid degradation. 
To explore the potential of the TAMC strain to produce organic acids 
and other industrially acidic chemicals, the growth of the WT and TAMC 
strains in the presence of 15 acids (based on their wide applications and 
production practicality) was compared. The following acids (listed in 
the order of increasing pKa values) were used: HCl, H3PO4, pyruvic acid, 
fumaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, gluconic acid, muconic acid, formic 
acid, itaconic acid, L-lactic acid, succinic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, 
acetic acid, and propionic acid. Based on the pH value selected in the 
previous experiment, five different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 400, 
and 800 mM) were selected to assess the effect of the abovementioned acids on the growth of the strains. Compared with the WT, TAMC 
exhibited improved tolerance to 12 of the 15 acids tested; the exceptions 
were formic, acetic, and 3-hydroxypropionic acids (Fig. 2). Due to the 
pKa values of various acids, the tolerance of strains may be different, 
which is a common phenomenon (Pham et al., 2017 ). Overall, the TAMC 
strain has a broad-spectrum acid tolerance and thus has considerable 
potential to be used as a microbial cell to produce acid compounds. 
3.3. Remodeling of the L-malic acid cytoplasmic synthesis pathway in the 
TAMC strain 
Taking L-malic acid as an example, the application of the TAMC 
strain in the synthesis of organic acids was verified. L-malic acid can be 
synthesized from pyruvate in the cytoplasm of S. cerevisiae using a two- 
step reaction, which including two key enzymes: MDH2 and PYC2 (Zelle 
et al., 2008 ). However, MDH2 is inactivated by glucose catabolism in the 
cytoplasm, which largely limits L-malic acid synthesis. To address this 
limitation, the isozyme MDH3 derived from peroxisomes was selected 
and the end-positioning tripeptide SKL (MDH 3ΔSKL) was removed 
(Fig. 3A). Using GFP as an indicator, fluorescence microscopy revealed 
that MDH3-GFP exhibited a “punctate ” distribution (presumed to be 
peroxisomes), whereas MDH3 ΔSKL was freely distributed in the cyto-
plasm, similar to MDH2-GFP (see supplementary material s). To verify 
whether MDH3 ΔSKL was active in the cytoplasm, MDH activity was

Sun et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 128580
7determined. These results showed that the enzyme activity in the re-
combinant strain TAMC-A3 (overexpression of mdh3ΔSKL in TAMC 
strain) was 1.6-fold that in strain TAMC-A1 (overexpression of mdh2 in 
TAMC strain) (Fig. 3B) and equivalent to that in strain TAMC-A2 
(overexpression of mdh3 in TAMC strain) (Fig. 3B, p 0.9). Mean -
while, the L-malic acid titer in strain TAMC-A3 was 4.2 g/L, which was 
3.6-fold that in strain TAMC-A1 (Fig. 3C). 
Subsequently, the gene PYC2 was severally overexpressed in strain 
TAMC and TAMC-A3 to obtain the strain TAMC-A4 and TAMC-A5, and 
the titers were 2.2 g/L and 7.3 g/L in the fermentation supernatant 
(Fig. 3C). 
3.4. Molecular engineering of SpMae1 for improved transport efficiency 
To further increase the L-malic acid titer in the fermentation super -
natant, the malic acid transporter SpMae1 from S. pombe was intro-
duced. First, the SpMae1 successfully anchors to the membrane in TAMC 
(see supplementary material s). Next, SpMae1 was overexpressed in strain TAMC-A5, yielding the strain TAMC-A6. The L-malic acid titer of 
TAMC-A6 strain was further improved to 24.0 g/L in the fermentation 
supernatant, but the accumulation was still 5.8 g/L in the cell precipitate 
(see supplementary material s), implying that the transport efficiency of 
SpMae1 was insufficient. 
To screen transporters with highly efficient transport, a high- 
throughput screening method (a biosensor sensitive to malic acid) was 
designed for the optimization of SpMae1. MalR is a response regulator 
for L-malic acid (Krause et al., 2012 ). With the low intracellular malate 
concentration, MalR binds to its binding sequence (TTAATTTA- 
AACAAAAA) to suppress the transcription of the downstream gene. On 
the contrary, with the high intracellular malate concentration, the DNA- 
binding activity of MalR is inhibited, which enables the transcription of 
downstream genes. (Zhang et al., 2021 ). MalR was heterologous 
expressed in the TAMC strain, thereby generating strain TAMC-B1. A 
hybrid promoter that contained the MalR-binding site (MalR box) in the 
promoter TEF1 region was constructed, which expressed GFP as an in-
dicator, to obtain the strain TAMC-B3 (WT TEF1 promoter expressing

Sun et al.

8GFP to generate strain TAMC-B2 as the control). The activity of the 
promoter TEF1 with or without the MalR box was determined by placing 
it in front of the GFP sequence. The strength of the hybrid promoter 
TEF1D (with the MalR box) was reduced 4.8-fold that of the original 
promoter TEF1 (Fig. 4A). These results indicated that MalR was able to 
markedly suppress the transcription of TEF1D and further bind to DNA 
to inhibit transcription in S. cerevisiae . 
To detect the L-malic acid response range, the exogenous MalK was 
introduced to generate a TAMC-B6 strain to assist the response to L-malic 
acid signal. MalK (malate sensor histidine kinase) able to communicate 
with MalR through phosphate transfer, after MalK receives the signal of 
malic acid (Fig. 4A) (Krause et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2021 ). As shown in 
Fig. 4B, the maximum threshold of the malic acid response was 
approximately 2.0–20.0 g/L, which can satisfy the intracellular residual 
concentration of L-malic acid. These results indicate that this biosensor 
can respond to changes in intracellular malic acid concentration, which 
in turn can be effectively applied for the improvement and optimization 
of SpMae1. 
Based on the abovementioned results, a SpMae1 mutant library was 
constructed using error-prone PCR to obtain transporters with random 
mutagenesis. Then the L-malic acid response system was introduced into 
the TAMC-A5 strain to obtain the TAMC-B7 strain, which was used to 
screen SpMae1 mutants. The mixed SpMae1 mutants were preliminarily 
screened according to fluorescence intensity (see supplementary mate-
rials), and 15 mutants were obtained (Fig. 4C). The 15 mutants were 
further confirmed using culture assays in 250-mL flasks, and the results 
showed that the L-malic acid titers of 4 mutants (SpMae1-m4, SpMae1- 
m6, SpMae1-m11, and SpMae1-m15) were significantly improved 
compared with the control (TAMC-A6, including WT SpMae1) in the fermentation broth; the titers were 38.7, 59.3, 58.6, and 40.0 g/L, 
respectively, with the titers in the cell precipitate being 4.0, 2.4, 2.6, and 
4.9 g/L, respectively (Fig. 4D). Compared with the TAMC-A6 strain 
(containing WT SpMae1), the L-malic acid titer ratios in the fermentation 
broth of strains SpMae1-m6 and SpMae1-m11 were significantly 
increased and significantly reduced in the cell precipitates (Fig. 4D). 
3.5. Functional analysis of SpMae1 for the improvement of transport 
efficiency 
Based on the above results, the SpMae1 mutants were sequenced, 
and two positive mutants, F253C and F253A, were identified in strains 
SpMae1-m6 and SpMae1-m11, respectively. Because the F253 mutants 
significantly increased the L-malic acid accumulation in the fermenta -
tion broth, to further verify mutant effect on the transport efficiency, 
SpMae1F253C and SpMae1F253A was severally overexpressed in strain 
TAMC-A5 to generate strains TAMC-A7 and TAMC-A8. As shown in 
Fig. 4E, the L-malic acid titer in the fermentation supernatant was 67.4 
g/L in the TAMC-A7 strain and 73.6 g/L in the TAMC-A8 strain at 120 h, 
and the L-malic acid titer in the cell precipitate was reduced to 1.8 and 
1.3 g/L in the TAMC-A7 and TAMC-A8 strains, respectively. Surpris -
ingly, SpMae1 mutants did not negatively affect the membrane location 
(see supplementary material s). These results suggest that overexpression 
of SpMae1F253C and SpMae1F253A can potentially improve the L-malic 
acid transport efficiency and lead to its synthesis and accumulation in 
the fermentation supernatant (at least 37 times than that in the cell 
precipitate). Compared with the previous report (Zelle et al., 2008 ), 
SpMae1F253A not only increased the L-malic acid accumulation in the 
fermentation supernatant by 25 %, but also shortened the fermentation

Sun et al.

9time from 192 h to 120 h. 
To determine the reason for the improvement in transporter effi-
ciency in mutant F253, the molecular docking between the SpMae1 and 
L-malic acid was analyzed, and the result showed that the molecule of L- 
malic acid located within the transport channel. The transport channel 
was closed by residues containing phenyl rings (Fig. 5A). The mutants 
SpMae1F253A or SpMae1F253C had widened channels (Fig. 5B, 5C), which 
might be essential for transporter activity. The size of the substrate 
combination pocket of the WT SpMae1 is approximately 67 Å3, whereas 
the combination pockets of SpMae1F253C and SpMae1F253A are expanded 
to sizes of 135 Å3 and 188 Å3, respectively (Fig. 5B, 5C). In a previous 
study, two conserved aromatic residues located within the access tun-
nels were identified and proven to play key roles in the substrate activity 
of 1,2,3-trichloropropane (Pavlova et al., 2009 ). In another study, the 
size and shape of haloalkane dehalogenases entrance tunnel with 
different structures could be significantly affect the substrate specificity 
of these enzymes (Chaloupkova et al., 2003 ). 
3.6. Enhanced precursor substances for the efficient synthesis of L-malic 
acid 
To further improve the L-malic acid production, increasing the sup-
ply of precursors is an effective strategy. One of the important precursors 
of L-malic acid in cytoplasmic synthesis pathway is pyruvic acid (Liu 
et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2020a ). PYK, a major rate-limiting enzyme in the 
glycolytic process, is the key enzyme that catalyzes the production of 
pyruvic acid from phosphoenolpyruvate (Liu et al., 2017a; Liu et al., 
2017b ). As shown in Fig. 6A, the strain TAMC-A9 overexpressing PYK 
produced 75.5 g/L of L-malic acid in a 250-mL shake flask without any neutralizer added. This result shows that the strengthening precursor 
supply module of pyruvic acid is required to enhance the synthesis of L- 
malic acid. 
In addition, CYB2, a L-lactate dehydrogenase, could convert lactate 
to pyruvate, and its disruption usually improves lactate production in 
yeast (Ookubo et al., 2008 ). The CYB2 expression was enhanced to in-
crease the concentration of pyruvate and reduce that of the by-product 
lactic acid. Then, overexpression of CYB2 in strain TAMC-A9 to generate 
the strain TAMC-A10. As shown in Fig. 6A, without adding any 
neutralizer, the content of L-malic acid was 81.8 g/L in the TAMC-A10 
strain at 120 h, and the lactate titer was 1.3 g/L, which was reduced 
to 10 % of the yield in TAMC-A8 strain. These results shows that the 
CYB2 overexpression not only can significantly reduce the accumulation 
of by-product lactic acid, but also potentially increased synthesis of L- 
malic acid. 
3.7. Scale-up of L-malic acid production in a 3-L fermenter 
According to the encouraging L-malic acid titer achieved in flask 
culture, the stability in a large-scale bioreactor was tested. The engi-
neering strain TAMC-A10 was used to produce L-malic acid by a fed- 
batch culture in a 3-L fermenter. The results shown that the maximum 
L-malic acid titer was 232.9 g/L at 144 h, the yield per glucose was 0.66 
g/g and the productivity was 1.62 g/L/h, with the final fermentation 
broth pH was D3.0 (Fig. 6B). In addition, the concentration of the by- 
products in the fermentation supernatant, including fumaric acid, cit-
ric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, ethanol, were 2.6, 1.8, 1.1, 1.2, and 
0.6 g/L, respectively (see supplementary material s). 
To further verify whether low pH (without any neutralizer) affects

Sun et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Bioresource Technology 370 (2023) 128580
10the production performance of the L-malic acid, the above engineering 
strain TAMC-A10 was also cultured in 3-L fermenter with constant pH 
6.5 by the addition of neutralizer calcium carbonate. The results showed 
that the maximum L-malic acid titer was 227.5 g/L (the yield per glucose 
was 0.62 g/g and the productivity was 1.58 g/L/h) (Fig. 6C). These 
findings indicated that the production performance of the engineering 
strain was not affected at low pH. 
In previous studies, more than 150.0 g/L neutralizer was added, 
yielding considerable L-malate titers in some microbial platforms 
(Brown et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2020b ). Compared with previously re-
ported methods (Liu et al., 2018; Zelle et al., 2008 ), the abovementioned 
process for the generation of fermentation strains in this study did not 
require the addition of neutralizers. These findings further suggest that 
the S. cerevisiae mutant TAMC strain can be widely used for neutralizer- 
free sustainable bioproduction of industrial acid products. 
4.Conclusions 
In summary, a S. cerevisiae mutant TAMC strain with low pH toler-
ance of 2.3 was isolated using ALE. The microbial platform for the 
biosynthesis of L-malic acid was established by the TAMC strain. This 
study is the first to present the synthesis of L-malic acid in S. cerevisiae 
without neutralizers, which provides a green alternative method for 
producing L-malic acid. To sum up, this study constructed an acid 
resistant yeast chassis with potential for highly efficient bioproduction 
of L-malic acid without neutralizer, and the generated microbial cell 
factory may be extended for the bioproduction of other organic acids.
