Abstract
Pectin-rich residues are considered as promising feedstocks for sustainable production of platform chemicals. Enzymatic hydro-
lysis of extracted sugar beet press pulp (SBPP) releases the main constituent of pectin, D-galacturonic acid ( D-GalA). Using
engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae ,D-GalA is then reduced to L-galactonate ( L-GalOA) with sorbitol as co-substrate. The
current work addresses the combination of enzymatic hydrolysis of pectin in SBPP with a consecutive optimized biotransfor-
mation of the released D-GalA to L-GalOA in simple batch processes in stirred-tank bioreactors. Process conditions were first
identified with synthetic media, where a product concentration of 9.9 g L-1L-GalOA was obtained with a product selectivity of
99% (L-GalOA D-GalA-1) at pH 5 with 4% (w/v) sorbitol within 48 h. A very similar batch process performance with a product
selectivity of 97% was achieved with potassium citrate buffered SBPP hydrolysate, demonstrating for the first time direct
production of L-GalOA from hydrolyzed biomass using engineered S. cerevisiae . Combining the hydrolysis process of extracted
SBPP and the biotransformation process with engineered S. cerevisiae paves the way towards repurposing pectin-rich residues as
substrates for value-added chemicals.

Introduction
The bioconversion of agricultural residues into second-
generation biofuels has been well studied and extensively
reviewed (Kuivanen et al. 2019 ; Hortsch and Corvo 2020 ;Jansen et al. 2017 ; Lin and Tanaka 2006 ). The hydrolysis of
lignocellulosic plant residues is industrially established, and
hydrolysates are used for bioethanol production (Cardona and
Sánchez 2007 ; Erdei et al. 2012 ; Gírio et al. 2010 ). Plant
residues rich in pectin, such as extracted citrus fruits or sugar

/ Published online: 16 July 2021Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2021) 105:5795–5807beet pulps, have sparked interest in recent years as novel feed-
stocks with high potential for bioconversions (Edwards and
Doran-Peterson 2012 ). More than 250 million tons of citrus
fruits and sugar beets are harvested annually for juicing and
sugar refining (FAO 2020 ;K u i v a n e ne ta l . 2019 ). The residual
d r yp u l pc o n s i s t so f2 0 –40% (w/w) pectin, a
heteropolysaccharide comprised mainly of an α-1,4-linked
D-galacturonic acid backbone (Mohnen 2008 ). Depending
on the pectic subtype, D-GalA is alternated with L-rhamnose
monomers in the backbone, additionally being substitutedwith different mono- and oligosaccharide side chains
(Micard et al. 1996 ; Schmitz et al. 2019 ). Usually, the extract-
ed and dried pulps are used energetically or as animal feed
additive (Richard and Hilditch 2009 ;Z e m ae ta l . 2018 ).
To access monomeric
D-GalA from pectic residues, either
chemical or enzymatic pre-treatment is necessary. Chemicalpre-treatment seems favorable for degradation of the strong
cellulose and hemicellulose network surrounding the pectin inplant cell walls. However, formation of non-fermentable and
toxic byproducts for microorganisms during chemical hydro-
lysis, like furfural or hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), favorsthe utilization of enzymes for the degradation of pectic resi-
dues (Palmqvist and Hahn-Hägerdal 2000 ). Though less effi-
cient compared to the chemical breakdown, fewer potentiallyinhibitory components are formed (Martins et al. 2020 ).
Natively, fungi can hydrolyze this complex
heteropolysaccharide with a toolbox of different pectinase en-
zymes (Garg et al. 2016 ; Hassan et al. 2019 ; Kashyap et al.
2001 ;J a y a n ie ta l . 2005 ). Leijdekkers et al. ( 2013 )r e p o r t e da
hydrolysis yield of 79% resulting in 11.8 g L
-1D-GalA after
48 h from extracted sugar beet press pulp using different com-
mercially available enzyme mixtures. Recently, non-optimized Aspergillus niger strains were evaluated for their
pectinase activity to depolymerize different pectinaceous ag-ricultural residues (Schäfer et al. 2020 ). The resulting enzyme
cocktail was used for sodium acetate buffered hydrolysis of
extracted sugar beet press pulp at pH 4.5 in a batch process. In
total, 8.0 g L
-1of monomeric D-GalA could be released within
48 h with a yield of 36.4% (w/w).
Recent approaches to valorize low-value pectin-rich resi-
dues used microorganisms to produce higher value productsfrom
D-GalA. While Kuivanen et al. ( 2012 ) exploited deletion
mutants of A. niger for the reduction of D-GalA in batch pro-
cesses to produce up to 8.7 g L-1ofL-galactonate ( L-GalOA)
in 144 h, Protzko et al. ( 2018 ) used recombinant S. cerevisiae
for the oxidation of D-GalA. Up to 8 g L-1ofmeso- galactaric
acid were formed by the yeast cells in batch processes withglucose as co-substrate. Both biotransformation products have
potential applications as a pharmaceutical conjugate or chela-
tor in the industry (Kuivanen et al. 2019). Especially
L-
GalOA, being physico-chemically similar to D-gluconic acid,
may be applied as an alternative chelating agent in the cos-metic and food industries (Kuivanen et al. 2012 ). Its lactonicform,
L-galactono-1,4-lactone, is the precursor of vitamin C
(Kuivanen et al. 2015 ; Sauer et al. 2004 ) and an analog of
glucono- δ-lactone (E575), an acidifier applied in various
foodstuffs. While the application of filamentous fungi natively
producing L-GalOA might appear advantageous, the yeast
S. cerevisiae , being the microbial workhorse of bio-industry
(Hong and Nielsen 2012 ; Nielsen et al. 2013 ), surpasses the
fungus in fast genetic manipulation for metabolic engineering.
Furthermore, high growth rates resulting in shorter fermenta-tion processes and the production of utilizable byproducts
such as ethanol lower operating costs and the risk of potential
contamination by other microbes (van Maris et al. 2006 ).
S. cerevisiae has been engineered for the reduction of
D-
GalA, given that this yeast is natively unable to metabolize D-
GalA (van Maris et al. 2006 ). One auspicious metabolic engi-
neering approach was the expression of transporters from
A. niger orNeurospora crassa inS. cerevisiae enabling the
efficient uptake of D-GalA in yeast cells (Benz et al. 2014 ;
Harth et al. 2020 ; Protzko et al. 2018 ). Consecutively, D-GalA
is reduced with overexpressed NAD(P)H-dependent oxido-
reductases in the yeast cells (Richard and Hilditch 2009 ).
Biz et al. ( 2016 ) demonstrated the consumption of only 1 g
L-1D-GalA with engineered yeast strains expressing four
genes of the reductive D-GalA pathway from A. niger to pro-
duce ethanol in the presence of 80 g L-1fructose in 24 h. The
low conversion of D-GalA was ascribed to the higher oxida-
tion state of D-GalA compared to other hexoses, such as fruc-
tose, and an intracellula r lack of reducing factors.
Conclusively, the authors suggested the introduction of en-zymes to regenerate NAD(P)H in a stoichiometric manner
for
D-GalA reduction. This hypothesis is further supported
by Protzko et al. ( 2018 ), who showed preferred expression
of the NAD(P)H utilizing D-GalA reductase GaaA from
A. niger inS. cerevisiae in enrichment experiments with D-
GalA as the sole carbon source. Jeong et al. (2020)
approached this assumed lack of reducing equivalents by ex-
pressing enzymes from Ambrosiozyma monospora ,Pichia
stipitis , and T. reesei for the co-utilization of the pentoses
xylose and arabinose in yeast strains carrying different fungalenzymes from A. niger andT. reesei for the reduction of
D-
GalA. Fermentation of these sugars involves NAD(P)H gen-
erating pathways, and growth of engineered S. cerevisiae was
made possible with consumption of 33.7 g L-1xylose, 25.9 g
L-1arabinose, and 15.3 g L-1D-GalA as the sole carbon
sources, thereby overcoming the redox problem of D-GalA
catabolism in yeast. Lastly, Harth et al. ( 2020 ) described a
fully functional, redox-ba lanced enzyme system in
S. cerevisiae expressing the D-galacturonic acid transporter
from A. niger , AnGar1, an NADPH-dependent reductase from
A. niger , for the reduction of D-GalA to L-GalOA and an
NADP-dependent sorbitol dehydrogenase from Yarrowia
lypolytica (YlSdr) with sorbitol as the co-substrate to regener-
ate the reducing factors. In t his constellation, NADPH is5796 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2021) 105:5795–5807regenerated when sorbitol is oxidized to fructose achieving a
nearly complete conversion of D-GalA into 4.4 g L-1L-GalOA
within 8 days in batch processes with synthetic medium
(Harth et al. 2020 ).
With the engineered S. cerevisiae strain of Harth et al.
(2020 )a th a n d( S. cerevisiae SiHY001), the utilization of en-
zymatically hydrolyzed pectinaceous residues for L-GalOA
production seems feasible. Still, process conditions that favorthe enzymatic hydrolysis of sugar beet press pulp (SBPP) withpectinases from A. niger , as described by Schäfer et al. ( 2020 ),
do not necessarily support biotransformation conditions forthe recombinant yeast strain. Especially, the unique composi-tion and processing of pectinaceous hydrolysates may bear
unknown inhibitory substances for yeast (Martins et al.
2020 ). Therefore, we firstly studied the effects of pH, initial
sorbitol, and
D-GalA concentrations on L-GalOA production
with S. cerevisiae SiHY001 in simple batch processes in con-
trolled stirred-tank bioreactors with defined medium to adaptthe bioreduction process to the previous enzymatic hydrolysis
(Schäfer et al. 2020 ). Secondly, we adapted the enzymatic
hydrolysis process of SBPP for
D-GalA release to enable a
direct subsequent whole-cell biotransformation withS. cerevisiae SiHY001.
Materials and methods
Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from
Carl Roth GmbH or Sigma-Aldrich.
Microbial strains
Biotransformation of D-GalA to L-GalOA was studied with
S. cerevisiae SiHY001, which was earlier described to be
able to reduce D-GalA to L-GalOA with sorbitol as co-
substrate for growth and cofactor regeneration (Harthet al. 2020). S. cerevisiae SiHY001 contains expression
cassettes with the genes for (i) the endogenous sorbitol
transporter HXT13, (ii) the sorbitol dehydrogenase YlSdr
(UniProtKB —Q6CEE9) from Yarrowia lipolytica , (iii) the
D-galacturonic acid reductase AnGar1 (UniProtKB-
A2R7U3) from A. niger ,a sw e l la s( i v )t h e D-galacturonic
acid transporter AnGatA (UniProtKB —A2R3H2) fromA. niger . Cassettes were integrated into the URA3 locus
of the parental strain S. cerevisiae EBY.VW4000, an auxo-
trophic, hexose-transporter deficient strain (Wieczorkeet al. 1999). The cells were maintained in 25% (v/v) glyc-
erol stocks at –80 °C with a cell dry weight (CDW) con-
centration of 0.5 g L
-1(Table 1).
Seed cultures
For the inoculation of stirred-tank bioreactors, seed cul-tures were grown 72 h in autoclaved (121 °C, 20 min)

and 5 g L-1D-galacturonic acid at 30 °C and 180 rpm
(Multitron, Infors HT, Bottmingen, Switzerland). Shakeflasks were inoculated with 500 μL glycerol stocks of
S. cerevisiae strain SiHY001.
Preparation of inoculum for stirred-tank bioreactors
Inoculums for stirred-tank bioreactors were prepared by
centrifuging cells from seed cultures at 3000 g within
10 min at 4 °C (Rotixa 50 RS, Andreas Hettich GmbH &Co.KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) and washing the pellet twice
with sterile phosphate buffered saline (8 g L
-1NaCl, 0.2 g L-1
KCl, 1.44 g L-1Na2HPO 4,0 . 2 4gL-1KH 2PO4, pH 7.4). After
re-suspension in 5 mL sterile SC medium, bioreactors wereinoculated with an amount equivalent to 0.25 g L
-1cell dry
weight (CDW).
Medium preparation
The medium for pH variations was identical to the medium of
the seed cultures. For batch processes with varying medium

of the medium for the respective concentrations of sodium
acetate, citrate potassium acetate, or citrate.
Extracted, pre-dried, and milled SBPP with a particle size <
1 mm (Südzucker AG, Obrigheim, Germany) was hydrolyzedwith an enzyme mix produced from cultivation with A. niger.
Methods for pectinase production and pectinase (PGase) ac-
tivity measurements are described in detail by Schäfer et al.
(2020 ). For hydrolysis of residues, 70 g L
-1SBPP suspended
in 100 mM potassium citrate buffer was autoclaved (121 °C,
20 min). Sterile-filtered fermentation supernatant containing
the produced enzyme mixture equivalent to 57 U PGase/gSBPP was added afterwards together with kanamycin
(34μgm L
-1). Batch hydrolysis of 5 L SBPP suspension was
performed in stirred-tank reactors (Labfors 3, Infors HT,
Bottmingen, Switzerland) controlled at pH 4.5, 30 °C and
continuous stirring with two 3-blade segment impellers with
65 mm in diameter (Infors HT, Bottmingen, Switzerland) at
700 min-1for 169 h. The hydrolysate was harvested by cen-
trifugation for 60 min at 3260 rcf, and subsequently sterile-
filtrated applying filters with different pore sizes of 2.5 μm,
0.45μm, and 0.22 μm( W h a t m a n ™filter paper grade 5, 55

Batch processes in parallel stirred-tank bioreactors at
10 mL-scale
Sterile single-use bioreactors with baffles and with DO
and pH sensors (BZ1002, 2mag AG, Munich, Germanyand sensor spots for DO (PST3-HG) and pH (LG1),
PreSens Precision Sensing GmbH, Regensburg,
Germany) were operated with gas-inducing stirrers and10 mL reaction volume in a parallel bioreactor system
(bioreactor48, 2mag AG, Munich, Germany), embedded
in a liquid handling system for sampling (MICROLABSTAR
TMLetM, Hamilton Bonaduz AG, Switzerland).
Immobilized sensors for DO and pH monitoring wereequilibrated at least 30 min with sterile medium prior tosterile inoculation of each b ioreactor. Batch processes
were performed at 30 °C and 0.1 L min
-1of sterile air
with an impeller speed of 2000 rpm. Evaporation compen-sation was achieved by setting the headspace cooling of
the reactors to 20 °C and pre-saturating the inlet air with
water.Batch processes in parallel stirred-tank bioreactors at
600 mL-scale
Batch processes were performed with a parallelized lab-scale
stirred-tank bioreactor system (DASGIP® Parallel Bioreactor
System, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) applying aworking volume of 0.6 L. Each stirred-tank reactor was
equipped with probes for tem perature, dissolved oxygen
(DO) concentration, and pH, as well as feed lines for pH
control (1 M KOH, 0.5 M H
2SO4), 2 six-blade Rushton tur-
bines, and a gas mixing unit. Waste gas concentrations of O 2
and CO 2were monitored separately online with a gas analyzer
(EasyLine, ABB, Zurich, Switzerland) for each reactor. Prior
to inoculation, two-point DO calibration was performed at 2
vvm and 600 rpm by stripping the medium first with nitrogengas until DO = 0% air saturation was achieved and afterwards
with air until DO = 100% air saturation was achieved in the
fermentation medium at 30 °C. Aeration, temperature, and pHwere kept constant at 0.5 vvm, 30 °C and pH 5 except for pH
variation experiments. DO concentration was kept above 30%
air saturation by the controlled increase of the stirrer speedfrom initially 200 rpm to 800 rpm at the maximum.
Offline analytics
Optical density for the determination of cell densities wasperformed at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD
600) in 10-mm
cuvettes using a single beam photometer (Genesys 10S UV –
VIS, Thermo Scientific, Neuss, Germany) or with a micro-plate reader (Multiscan
TMFC, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, USA). Values obtained from the microplate reader
(MultiscanTMFC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA)
were correlated to the single beam photometer (OD 600)w i t ha
second order polynomial (OD 600=−3.6522 x2+3 . 9 7 5x+
0.0032; R2=0 . 9 9 9 8 ) .
For the determination of cell dry weight (CDW) concentra-
tions, pre-dried (24 h, 80 °C) and pre-weighted reaction tubeswere filled with 2 mL cell suspension and centrifuged for
10 min at 13,000 g. The supernatant was discarded, and thecell pellet dried for 24 h at 80°C. CDW was determined gravi-
metrically and correlated to optical densities (OD
600),
resulting in a linear correlation factor of 0.61 g L-1.
Maximum growth rates were estimated by linear regression
after plotting the logarithm of the CDW concentrations during
exponential growth as a function of the process time.
Metabolites in the fermentation broth were determined
with high-performance liquid chromatography (Agilent1100, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, USA or
Shimadzu Prominence-i LC-2030C Plus, Shimadzu
Scientific Instruments, Inc., Japan) equipped with an RI de-tector (Agilent 1200, Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara,

stat. Samples for analysis were centrifuged for 10 min at13,000 g and filtered (0.22 μmp o r es i z e ,C h r o m a f i lR C 2 0 /
15 MS, Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co.KG, Düren, Germany).Separation of substrates was achieved with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Biorad, Munich, Germany) at 60 °C using a
flow rate of 0.5 mL min

acid.
Results
Biotransformations at varying pH
Pectinolytic enzymes favor acidic pH for hydrolysis of pecti-naceous residues (Kashyap et al. 2001 ). To avoid a different
pH for hydrolysis and biotransformation, five standardized
batch processes wer e performed with S. cerevisiae
SiHY001 at pH set points between pH 3 and pH 5 with SCmedium in stirred-tank bioreactors at 600 mL-scale. Initial
D-
GalA concentrations of 5 g L-1were chosen based on the
reported D-GalA concentrations measured after enzymatic hy-
drolysis (Schäfer et al. 2020 ). While similar final biomass
concentrations of 4.1 –5.0 g L-1CDW were observed at all
pH set points, final L-GalOA concentrations varied greatly
between 1.1 and 3.6 g L-1(Fig. 1). The highest product con-
centration and product yield Y P/Sorbitol was observed at pH 5
with 3.6 g L-1L-GalOA, and 0.49 ± 0.04 mol L-GalOA mol-1
sorbitol, respectively. A nearly stoichiometric biotransforma-tion yield Y
P/Ewas observed within the estimation error
(0.92 –1.02 mol L-GalOA mol-1D-GalA) independent of the
pH (Table 2), indicating the absence of any further metabo-
lism of either D-GalA or L-GalOA by the yeast cells.
At all pH set points studied, growth of S. cerevisiae
SiHY001 was finished after ~ 3 days and the remainingsorbitol was further consumed by the resting cells (mainte-
nance metabolism). No biotransformation activities were ob-
served with the resting cells at pH < 4.0, whereas considerablebiotransformation activity was observed at pH 4.5 and pH 5.0
(Fig. 1) in the stationary phase. Notably, the growth-coupled
biotransformation activity of S. cerevisiae SiHY001 contrib-
uted predominantly to
L-GalOA production (85% at pH 4.5,
and 79% at pH 5.0, respectively). Based on the observed best
biotransformation results with S. cerevisiae SiHY001 at pH
5.0, this pH was chosen as the set point for further studies.
Biotransformations with varying initial sorbitol
concentrations
To avoid any co-substrate limitations in the batch biotransfor-
mation processes, three standardized batch processes were
performed with S. cerevisiae SiHY001 with increasing initial
sorbitol concentrations at pH 5 with SC medium in stirred-
tank bioreactors at 600 mL-scale keeping the initial D-GalA
concentration constant at 5.2 g L-1. At 1% (w/v) sorbitol, a
final biomass concentration of 3.8 g L-1was reached com-
pared to 4.8 g L-1a n d7 . 6gL-1at 2% (w/v) and 4% (w/v)
sorbitol, respectively (Fig. 2). The final product concentra-
tions were improved as well with increasing initial sorbitol
concentrations (3.6 g L-1L-GalOA with 1% (w/v) sorbitol,
4 . 3gL-1L-GalOA with 2% (w/v) sorbitol, and 5.2 g L-1L-
GalOA with 4% (w/v) sorbitol, respectively). Unfortunately,
D-GalA was already consumed after 2 days with 4% (w/v)
sorbitol, so that the increased concentration of the
S. cerevisiae SiHY001 biocatalysts could not be used to full
capacity during further batch processing. On the other hand, L-
GalOA space-time yield (0.1 g L-1h-1) was very much im-
proved with 4% (w/v) sorbitol at full conversion of D-GalA
after a process time of 2 days compared to the other batch
processes, in which full conversion was not even reached after
7d a y s( F i g .2 ).
Due to the increased consumption of sorbitol for biomass
formation with increasing initial sorbitol concentrations, thefinal
L-GalOA yield Y P/Sorbitol decreased from 0.45 mol L-
GalOA mol-1sorbitol at the lowest initial sorbitol concentra-
tion, to 0.26 mol L-GalOA mol-1sorbitol at twice as much
initial sorbitol and to 0.13 mol L-GalOA mol-1sorbitol at the
four-fold of initial sorbitol. Additionally, an increased pro-
duction of non-respiratory metabolites like acetate, glycerol,
and especially ethanol was observed with increasing initial
sorbitol concentrations (0.0 g L-1EtOH with 1% (w/v) sor-
bitol, 1.0 g L-1EtOH with 2% (w/v) sorbitol, and 4.1 g L-1
EtOH with 4% (w/v) sorbitol, respectively). To avoid anylimitation caused by co-substrate supply, further batch pro-cesses were performed with 4% initial sorbitol concentration

components
The first biotransformation of hydrolyzed SBPP was studied
at pH 5 with 4% (w/v) sorbitol in a stirred-tank bioreactor. No
growth, no sorbitol consumption, no D-GalA consumption,
and no L-GalOA production were observed with
S. cerevisiae SiHY001 (data not shown). Enzymatic hydroly-
sis of SBPP had been performed in 100 mM sodium acetate
buffer (Schäfer et al. 2020 ). As acetic acid is known to affect
the metabolism of S. cerevisiae already at concentrations as
low as 3 mM (Sousa et al. 2012 ), growth of S. cerevisiae
SiHY001 was studied in miniaturized single-use stirred tank
reactors with diverse buffers and buffer concentrations at pH5.0 in SC medium (sodium acetate, sodium citrate, potassium
acetate, and potassium citrate). No growth was observed with
acetate buffered media at all concentrations (data not shown).Increasing sodium citrate concentrations resulted in reduced
maximum growth rates in batch processes, whereas potassium
citrate had no effect on the maximum growth rate at 200 mMand above (Fig. 3). Consequently, the sodium acetate buffer
was replaced by 100 mM potassium citrate buffer at pH 5.0 forall further enzymatic hydrolyses of SBPP.
Biotransformation with sugar beet press pulp
hydrolysate
SBPP prepared with 100 mM potassium citrate buffer was
used for biotransformations at pH 5 in stirred-tank bioreactors.
Initial sugar concentrations after medium preparation with
SBPP hydrolysate were 40 g L-1sorbitol, 5 g L-1D-GalA,
9.4 g L-1glucose, 13.9 g L-1arabinose, and 3.2 g L-1xylose/
mannose/galactose, respectively. Batch process performanceofS. cerevisiae SiHY001 was very similar to processes with

achieved within 2 days. No significant growth could be ob-
served afterwards, although 5.5 g L-1sorbitol were present in
SC medium, and 3.0 g L-1sorbitol in SBPP hydrolysate me-
dium, respectively. Biotransformation of D-GalA was already
finished within 1.5 days with nearly stoichiometric biotrans-
formation yield Y P/Eof 0.99 mol L-GalOA mol-1D-GalA with
SC medium and 0.94 ± 0.04 mol L-GalOA mol-1D-GalA with
SBPP hydrolysate medium. Product yield Y P/sorbitol was im-
proved with SBPP hydrolysate medium compared to SC me-dium (0.16 ± 0.01 mol
L-GalOA mol-1sorbitol, and 0.13 mol
L-GalOA mol-1sorbitol, respectively).
CO 2concentrations in the off-gas differed considerably
between the biotransformation processes (Fig. 4). SBPP hy-
drolysate resulted in increased CO 2production between a
process time of 1 –2.2 days. This might result from the con-
sumption of initial acetate (1.0 g L-1) provided with SBPP
hydrolysate and the re-consumption of ethanol duringbiotransformation within the first 2 days. Re-consumptionof ethanol was very much delayed in the biotransformation
with SC medium.
Glycerol accumulation of up to nearly 6 g L
-1was only
observed with SBPP hydrolysate (Fig. 4), presumably a reac-
tion of S. cerevisiae to components of the hydrolysate
(Nielsen and Arneborg 2007 ;S c a n e se ta l . 1998 ). No fermen-
tation of other hexoses in SBPP hydrolysate, namely galactoseand mannose, could be observed due to the strain ’s inability to
consume these sugars (Wieczorke et al. 1999 ).
Biotransformations with increased initial d-GalA
concentrations
Theoretically, higher initial D-GalA concentrations of up to 15 g
L-1should be accessible after enzymatic hydrolysis of SBPP.
AsD-GalA reduction by S. cerevisiae SiHY001 occurs predom-
inantly growth-coupled and the maximum CDW concentration

sorbitol and final sorbitol conve rsions of 87%, the initial con-

creased in biotransformations with 15 g L-1D-GalA to avoid
any limitation. Increased initial a mino acid concentrations in the
medium resulted in no significant alterations of the batch pro-cesses with the auxotrophic yeast strain (data not shown).
Considerably higher biomass concentrations (11.6 g L
-1)
were achieved with a ten-fold initial increase of the concen-trations of trace elements, vitamins, and salts in the SC medi-
um (10-fold SC medium) (Fig. 5). This resulted in an in-

proved with 10-fold SC medium. Up to 9.9 ± 0.10 g L-1L-
GalOA were formed from 15 g L-1D-GalA (conversion of
61%), but biotransformation stopped after 48 h for unknown
reasons. The remaining 7.8 g L-1sorbitol were consumed
subsequently for growth of the yeast cells until the batch pro-cess was finished after 4 days. This suggests that the initial
D-
GalA concentrations should not be higher than 10 g L-1to
achieve full conversion to L-GalOA within 48 h in the batch
biotransformat ion process with S. cerevisiae SiHY001
(Table 4).Discussion
Valorization of pectin-rich residues has moved into focus inrecent years. The simultaneous hydrolysis of pectin in extract-ed SBPP and subsequent direct biotransformation of the re-
leased monomer
D-GalA would reduce production costs.
Enzymatic hydrolysis of pectin in SBPP was reported to bebest at pH 4.5 (Schäfer et al. 2020 ). Although S. cerevisiae is
known for high tolerance towards low pH (Narendranath and
Power 2005 )a n d S. cerevisiae growth kinetics are not affected
by pH 3.5 –6.0 (Carmelo et al. 1996 ), the best overall perfor-
mance of the biotransformation of
D-GalA to L-GalOA with
S. cerevisiae SiHY001 was observed at pH 5, the maximum
pH under study. The previously suggested passive D-GalA
uptake by S. cerevisiae at low pH was not observed in our
experiments (Souffriau et al. 2012 ) and low pH did not con-
tribute to enhanced L-GalOA production. D-GalA conversion
to ethanol or meso -galactaric acid was so far studied solely
without pH control in shake flasks (Biz et al. 2016 ; Jeong et al.
2020 ; Protzko et al. 2018 ). For the direct combination of hy-
drolysis and biotransformation, a compromise is needed be-tween the best pH for enzymatic hydrolysis of the pectin in
SBPP (pH 4.5) and the best pH for biotransformation of
D-
GalA to L-GalOA with S. cerevisiae SiHY001 (pH 5.0).

biotransformation processes at full conversion to reduce the
total costs of biotransformation processes, including down-stream processing. At high glucose concentrations, repression
of respiration and formation of fermentative by-products is
observed with S. cerevisiae due to the so-called Crabtree ef-
fect (De Deken 1966 ; Pfeiffer and Morley 2014 ). Although
not specifically described for sorbitol, it was suggested thatglycolysis-derived hexose phosphates induce this effect(Lemus et al. 2018 ). Since sorbitol is oxidized to fructose,
and, after phosphorylation, enters glycolysis as fructose-6-phosphate, this might account for the increased non-respiratory behavior of the strain under aerobic conditions.
Even with residual 5.8 g L
-1sorbitol left in the medium after
48 h (Fig. 2and Fig. 4), ethanol is consumed. The reasons may
be the moderate affinity of the Hxt13 transporter for sorbitol(Jordan et al. 2016) or a self-regulative mechanism of
S. cerevisiae to avoid inhibiting concentrations of metabolites
(Sousa et al. 2012 ). To the best of our knowledge, batch pro-
duction of 9.9 ± 0.1 g L
-1LGalOA within 48 h (space-time
yield of 0.19±0.0 g L-1h-1) with 4% (v/w) sorbitol is the
highest concentration and space-time yield reported withS. cerevisiae in the literature and even exceeds the
L-GalOA
production with filamentous fungi reported so far (Kuivanenet al. 2014 ).
S. cerevisiae is described to withstand harsh conditions and
stresses at the industrial scale (Hong and Nielsen 2012 )a n d
has been used for the fermentation of hydrolyzed pectinaceous
residues to produce ethanol (Martins et al. 2020 ). One of the
main challenges in the utilization of agro-industrial residues
remain the release of weak organic acids and other com-
pounds during hydrolysis (van Maris et al. 2006 )t h a tm a y
inhibit growth of S. cerevisiae . Enzymatic hydrolysis of
pretreated agro-industrial residues, however, requires an ade-quate buffer system for optimal performance of hydrolyticenzymes. The prior hydrolysis of SBPP with pectinases was
initially performed in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer (Schäfer
et al. 2020 ). It has been widely described that the main inhi-
bition of S. cerevisiae by acetic acid is its intracellular accu-
mulation (Mira et al. 2010 ; Sousa et al. 2012 ). Acetic acid
diffuses across the cytoplasm membrane and dissociates intoacetate and H
3O+due to the higher cytosolic pH compared to
the extracellular environment, resulting in intracellular acetateaccumulation (Pampulha and Loureiro-Dias 1989 ) and affect-
ing various intracellular mechanisms that lead to reduced or
stalled cell growth (Sousa et al. 2012 ). In contrast, citric acid/
citrate does not have this effect on S. cerevisiae while it can be
growth-inhibiting at higher pH due to its ability to chelatecations (Nielsen and Arneborg 2007 ). Accordingly, we ob-
served no significant difference in growth rates up to
200 mM potassium citrate buffer in our medium (Fig. 3).
Concerning the buffer ’s ionic component, sodium affects cell
growth negatively when present in the medium. Unlikepotassium ions, high extracellular concentrations of sodium
ions may disrupt osmotic regulation of the cell and hence
induce stress, which results in reduced growth (Ariño et al.2010 ;H o h m a n n 2002 ).
To the best of our knowledge, SBPP hydrolysate has not
been used before for
L-GalOA production by recombinant
S. cerevisiae . Reports on the fermentation of pectin-rich resi-
dues such as citrus peel or SBPP were mainly motivated forbioethanol production (Edwards et al. 2011 ; Martins et al.
2020 ) or towards whole pectin utilization as carbon source
for growth (Huisjes et al. 2012 ; Jeong et al. 2020 ; Protzko
et al. 2018 ;Y a n ge ta l . 2020). Process performance of
S. cerevisiae SiHY001 with SBPP hydrolysate was very sim-
ilar to the performance with synthetic complete medium (SCmedium). However, increased production of glycerol could beobserved with SBPP hydrolysate and with 10-fold SC medi-
um compared to SC medium. With otherwise identical pro-
cess conditions, the higher glycerol concentrations cannot beaccounted for solely to glycerol being formed as an NADH
sink during fermentative growth as a result of the Crabtree
effect (Nevoigt and Stahl 1997 ). More likely, glycerol acts
as a response to hyperosmotic stress in 10-fold SC medium
(Nevoigt and Stahl 1997 ). The salty components (sodium
chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium sulfate, and potassiumphosphate) accumulated in 10-fold SC medium to a total of
0.142 M. Although not as high as reported to induce “mild
osmotic stress” for yeast with 0.4 M sodium chloride
(Babazadeh et al. 2017 ), glycerol formation might neverthe-
less be induced. The much higher glycerol production withSBPP can, however, be explained by an upregulation of pro-
teins involved in glycerol biosynthesis as a stress response of
S. cerevisiae to citric acid (Lawrence et al. 2004 ; Nielsen and
Arneborg 2007 ). Further environmental factors might as well
synergistically contribute to an overall higher glycerol levelwith SBPP (Remize et al. 2000 ). Unlike with synthetic com-
plete medium, 26.5 g L
-1non-fermentable monomeric sugars
(0.07 M) from SBPP hydroly sate remain in the medium
throughout the batch process, since the yeast strain lacks mul-tiple hexose transporter genes to transport these sugars
(Wieczorke et al. 1999 ). Also, a considerable amount of crude
protein is present in SBPP hydrolysate (Edwards and Doran-
Peterson 2012 ), potentially acting as nitrogen source that in-
duces glycerol formation (Scanes et al. 2017 ).
All previous findings show highest product formation dur-
ing exponential growth and prolonging this phase is therefore
desirable .Since we were using an auxotrophic strain, the ini-
tial approach was to increase the concentration of required
amino acids to overcome limitations (Pronk 2002 ). This did
not result in improved biomass formation or biotransforma-tion activity. However, increasing the concentration of vita-mins, trace elements, and salts in the medium resulted in both
a significantly higher biomass concentration (Fig. 5)a n d
slightly increased growth rat e, consequently improving5804 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2021) 105:5795–5807biotransformation activity and L-GalOA formation within the
first 48 h of the batch process. From our results, we cannot
derive which medium component positively affected growth.Since addition of amino acids did not lead to a different
growth behavior of S. cerevisiae , the strain ’s auxotrophies
are not the bottleneck .However, our results reflect findings
from other studies (Roberts et al. 2020 ). Here, a higher num-
ber of cells was reached by increasing the concentration of all
components of the synthetic defined medium. Still, biotrans-formation was stalled within 48 h, even though sufficient sor-
bitol and
D-GalA were present in the medium (Fig. 5). From
our results, we cannot pinpoint the reason for this. It was
described earlier that low sorbitol levels lead to slower trans-
port kinetics of the Hxt13 transporter (Jordan et al. 2016 ),
possibly limiting supply of NADPH for the reduction of D-
GalA. This might be overcome by applying a fed-batch pro-cess to maintain sorbitol levels above this threshold, but re-
peated sorbitol additions were also not successful (data notshown).
To access a wider NADPH-pool for
D-GalA reduction,
different genetic engineering approaches could be applied.Kim et al. ( 2018 ) increased NADPH levels by replacing sev-
eral NAD
+-utilizing enzymes from the acetate and ammonium
assimilation and pentose phosphate pathways in yeast with
equivalent NADPH-generating enzymes. A similar approach
was chosen by Verho et al. ( 2003 ) to overcome NADPH re-
quirements for pentose fermentation in yeast. They expressed
af u n g a lN A D P+-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate de-
hydrogenase to generate NADPH. Attempts have also been
made to address the redox problem by side directed mutagen-
esis of the respective D-GalA reductase to achieve a higher
acceptance of NADH as reducing factor (Harth et al. 2020 ),
widening the pool of utilizable reducing factors for the pro-duction of
L-GalOA. Furthermore, strategies should be de-
ployed to valorize as many monomeric sugars from SBPP
hydrolysate (Jeong et al. 2020 ) as possible. The presented
biotransformation process paves the way for integratedbioprocess development (hydrolysis, biotransformation, and
L-GalOA isolation) towards repurposing pectin-rich residues
for the production of value-added chemicals. This eventuallyrequires the integration of all genes enabling biotransforma-tion of
D-GalA in a robust industrial S. cerevisiae strain (Pronk
2002 ) and also the development of a cost-efficient down-
stream process. Isolation of the product might be achievedby similar methods as described by Zhou et al. ( 2018 ).
